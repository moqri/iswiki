|abstract = This article identifies the issues which MIS management rates as most important and most difficult to solve over the next two years.  The results were obtained from a 1985 opinion survey of MIS managers in over 100 St. Louis area companies.  The most important issues fall into three categories:  aligning MIS with corporate goals, software development, and end-user computing; the least important issues were narrowly focused or more technical.  Comparison with prior research reveals that the alignment and end-user computing issues have increased in importance.  The results indicate that MIS managers are more oriented to corporate than to technical issues.
