|abstract = This article identifies the issues which MIS management rates as most important and most difficult to solve over the next two years.  The results were obtained from a 1985 opinion survey of MIS managers in over 100 St. Louis area companies.  The most important issues fall into three categories:  aligning MIS with corporate goals, software development, and end-user computing; the least important issues were narrowly focused or more technical.  Comparison with prior research reveals that the alignment and end-user computing issues have increased in importance.  The results indicate that MIS managers are more oriented to corporate than to technical issues.

|abstract = The orientation of an information systems department is influenced by the emphasis shown in the manager’s activities. Each incident in the manager’s daily work is another bead strung on a necklace. The choice of what type of bead it should be is up to the manager. Every incident permits a choice of emphasis: either a systems professional or a user community orientation.Recent analyses suggest that a new breed of information systems manager must emerge for advanced systems in organizations. Some of these analyses emphasize the user view without pointing to the continuing need for systems competence.Lest the pendulum swing too far in the opposite direction by ignoring technical aspects, this analysis suggests that the emerging information systems manager must bring a “balanced” systems and user orientation to the position. In so doing, the manager establishes the organizational climate in which the information systems activity proceeds.

|page=57-57
|abstract = Planning for a successful MIS implementation requires understanding the effects of the introduction of a new system on the work lives of potential adopters. The effects can bee assessed by the MIS practitioner/change agent if the agent will first obtain a thorough and specific understanding of the task activities performed by potential adopters, the interactions they engage in as they perform their tasks, and their preferences for, or feelings about, those activities and interactions. An interview based approach to gathering this data is described, and a short description of an implementation in which the approach was used is provided.

|volume=12
|issue=1
|page=23-23
|abstract = A joint venture between a university-based research institute and a health insurance company to build a knowledge-based system to perform medical review of health insurance claims is described.  In an early format test, the system made appropriate decisions for approximately 70% of the claims.  The remaining claims were referred to human reviewers in accordance with company policy.  Forming a joint venture proved to be a reasonable cost alternative to distant and more expensive consultants.The article examines the impact of the differing cultures of the company and the university on the cohesion in the joint knowledge engineering group.  It also examines the current literature on the development cycle for building knowledge-based systems as the framework for analyzing the events in this project, particularly the influence of the claims review task on system design.  From another perspective, it examines participant roles in terms of shifts of attention among domain knowledge, knowledge representation, system performance, and the kinds of skills needed to improve the evolving system.  The conclusion includes a series of recommendations that may assist other companies and universities setting up similar joint ventures.

This study investigates whether internal auditors possess such skills.  A second objective is to investigate the impact of recall versus recognition in the identification of control weaknesses and control measures.Two major findings are reported.  First, no consistent between group differences in different aspects of internal control evaluation were found.  Second, a significant prompting effect was shown across all three respondent groups.

|abstract = For the last 25 years, organizations have invested heavily in information technology to support their work processes.  In today’s organizations, intra- and interorganizational work systems are increasingly IT-enabled.  Available evidence, however, suggests the functional potential of these installed IT applications is underutilized.  Most IT users apply a narrow band of features, operate at low levels of feature use, and rarely initiate extensions of the available features.  We argue that organizations need aggressive tactics to encourage users to expand their use of installed IT-enabled work systems.  This article strives to accomplish three primary research objectives.  First, we offer a comprehensive research model aimed both at coalescing existing research on post-adoptive IT use behaviors and at directing future research on those factors that influence users to (continuously) exploit and extend the functionality built into IT applications.  Second, in developing this comprehensive research model, we provide a window (for researchers across a variety of scientific disciplines interested in technology management) into the rich body of research regarding IT adoption, use, and diffusion.  Finally, we discuss implications and recommend guidelines for research and practice.

|issue=1
|page=3-3
|abstract = Information systems research has traditionally focused on information as an object that serves as input to decision making. Such a perspective attends mainly to the use of information. Increasingly, however, organizations are concerned about the production of information. This paper focuses on the work of producing informational objects, an activity central to knowledge work. Based on data collected during an eight-month ethnographic study of three groups of knowledge workers-computer system administrators, competitive intelligence analysts, and librarians - I explore the informing practices they relied upon. These are identified as ex-pressing, monitoring, and translating. Common to these informing practices is the knowledge workers’ endeavor to balance subjectivity and objectivity, where subjectivity is a necessary part of doing value adding work and objectivity promises workers authority and a sense of security. Recognizing that researchers are knowledge workers too, I draw on my own experiences as an ethnographic researcher to identify parallels between my informing practices and those of the knowledge workers I studied. These parallels are intended to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions underlying scientific practice. I adopt a confessional genre of representation for this purpose.

|page=43-43
|abstract = Despite the recognition of how important expertise coordination is to the performance of software development teams, understanding of how expertise is coordinated in practice is limited.  We adopt a configural approach to develop a theoretical model of expertise coordination that differentiates between design collaboration and technical collaboration.  We propose that neither a strictly centralized, top-down model nor a largely decentralized approach is superior.  Our model is tested in a field study of 71 software development teams.  We conclude that because design work addresses ill-structured problems with diverse potential solutions, decentralization of design collaboration can lead to greater coordination success and reduced team conflict.  Conversely, technical work benefits from centralized collaboration.  We find that task knowledge tacitness strengthens these relationships between collaboration configuration and coordination outcomes and that team conflict mediates the relationships.  Our findings underline the need to differentiate between technical and design collaboration and point to the importance of certain configurations in reducing team conflict and increasing coordination success in software development teams.  This paper opens up new research avenues to explore the collaborative mechanisms underlying knowledge team performance.9/2/16

'''A Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the End-User Computing Satisfaction Instrument'''

|year= 1994
|volume=18
|issue=4
|page=-
|abstract = The dimensionality of the user satisfaction construct is an important theoretical issue that has received considerable attention. Focusing on end users who directly interact with application software, Doll and Torkzadeah (1988) develop a 12-item application specific instrument for providing an overall assessment of end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS). They also contend that EUCS is comprised of five component measures (content, accuracy, format, ease of use, timeliness) that explain the construct and permit more precision in formulating and testing research hypotheses. The acceptance of the EUCS as a standardized instrument requires confirmation that it explains and measures the user satisfaction construct.Based on a sample of 409 respondents from 18 organizations, this research uses confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL) to test alternative models of underlying factor structure and assess the reliability and validity of factors and items. Without respecifying the model, the results provide some support for Doll and Torkzadeh's proposed model of the five first-order factors and one second-order (higher-order) factor. Thus the evidence supports the use of: (1) the 12-item instrument as an overall measure of EUCS; and (2) the five component factors for explaining the EUCS construct.

|page=479-479
|abstract = E-commerce is growing to represent an increasing share of overall sales revenue, and online sales are expected to continue growing for the foreseeable future.  This growth translates into increased activity on the supporting infrastructure, leading to a corresponding need to scale the infrastructure.  This is difficult in an era of shrinking budgets and increasing functional requirements.  Increasingly, IT managers are turning to virtualized cloud providers, drawn by the pay-for-use business model.  As cloud computing becomes more popular, it is important for data center managers to accomplish more with fewer dollars (i.e., to increase the utilization of existing resources).  Advanced request distribution techniques can help ensure both high utilization and smart request distribution, where requests are sent to the service resources best able to handle them.  While such request distribution techniques have been applied to the web and application layers of the traditional online application architecture, request distribution techniques for the data layer have focused primarily on online transaction processing scenarios.  However, online applications often have a significant read-intensive workload, where read operations constitute a significant percentage of workloads (up to 95 percent or higher).  In this paper, we propose a cost-based database request distribution (C-DBRD) strategy, a policy to distribute requests, across a cluster of commercial, off-the-shelf databases, and discuss its implementation.  We first develop the intuition behind our approach, and describe a high-level architecture for database request distribution.  We then develop a theoretical model for database load computation, which we use to design a method for database request distribution and build a software implementation.  Finally, following a design science methodology, we evaluate our artifacts through experimental evaluation.  Our experiments, in the lab and in production-scale systems, show significant improvement of database layer resource utilization, demonstrating up to a 45 percent improvement over existing request distribution techniques.

'''A Cross-Cultural Study on Escalation of Commitment Behavior in Software Projects'''

|abstract = One of the most challenging decisions that a manager must confront is whether to continue or abandon a troubled project. Published studies suggest that failing software projects are often allowed to continue for too long before appropriate management action is taken to discontinue or redirect the efforts. The level of sunk cost associated with such projects has been offered as one explanation for this escalation of commitment behavior. What prior studies fail to consider is how concepts from risk-taking theory (such as risk propensity and risk perception) affect decision makers’ willingness to continue a project under conditions of sunk cost. To better understand factors that may cause decision makers to continue such projects, this study examines the level of sunk cost together with the risk propensity and risk perception of decision makers. These factors are assessed for cross-cultural robustness using matching laboratory experiments carried out in three cultures (Finland, the Netherlands, and Singapore). With a wider set of explanatory factors than prior studies, we could account for a higher amount of variance in decision makers’ willingness to continue a project. The level of sunk cost and the risk perception of decision makers contributed significantly to their willingness to continue a project. Moreover, the risk propensity of decision makers was inversely related to risk perception. This inverse relationship was significantly stronger in Singapore (a low uncertainty avoidance culture) than in Finland and the Netherlands (high uncertainty avoidance cultures). These results reveal that some factors behind decision makers’ willingness to continue a project are consistent across cultures while others may be culture-sensitive. Implications of these results for further research and practice are discussed.

|abstract = Information systems researchers have drawn on the resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capabilities theory to offer a sharper theoretical lens to study the impact of information technology (IT) enabled capabilities on organizational performance.  In this study, we propose a new conceptualization of IT-enabled production capability, based on the ability of a manufacturing plant to use its mix of resource inputs to maximize its process outputs.  Our approach extends the literature on firm capability using data envelopment analysis (DEA), a nonparametric approach for estimating relative efficiencies of decision-making units.  We tested our models using plant-level data collected from a sample of U.S. plants.  Our study makes a key contribution by developing a new methodology to measure IT business value with respect to the role of IT-enabled production capability.   We operationalize a new DEA-based measure of capability using the relative efficiency of converting plant inputs into process outputs, a significant departure from extant research that has primarily focused on subjective and absolute measures to conceptualize capability.7/8/16

'''A Decision Aid for Selecting Among Information System Alternatives'''

|year= 1987
|volume=11
|issue=2
|page=177-177
|abstract = Many information system selection decisions, software decisions, hardware decisions, and project selection decisions involve characteristics that are of a qualitative nature.  Present methodologies either ignore the problem of selecting qualitative attributes, or require the assignment of a numerical value to a qualitative variable in order to make a choice involving qualitative benefits.  These approaches require application of artificial measures to qualitative variables.  A procedure that overcomes these difficulties for selection problems with known alternatives is presented.  The procedure is an implicit enumeration procedure based on properties of preference theory, requires no formal optimization procedure, and would be simple to implement in an interactive decision setting involving selection from among a set of known alternatives.

'''A Design Theory for Systems That Support Emergent Knowledge Processes'''

{{article
|author= Les Gasser Ann Majchrzak M. Lynne Markus,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2002
|volume=26
|issue=3
|page=179-179
|abstract = This paper addresses the design problem of providing IT support for emerging knowledge processes (EKPs). EKPs are organizational activity patterns that exhibit three characteristics in combination:  an emergent process of deliberations with no best structure or sequence; requirements for knowledge that are complex (both general and situational), distributed across people, and evolving dynamically; and an actor set that is unpredictable in terms of job roles or prior knowledge.  Examples of EKPs include basic research, new product development, strategic business planning, and organization design.  EKPs differ qualitatively from semi-structured decision making processes; therefore, they have unique requirements that are not all thoroughly supported by familiar classes of systems, such as executive information systems, expert systems, electronic communication systems, organizational memory systems, or repositories.  Further, the development literature on familiar classes of systems does not provide adequate guidance on how to build systems that support EKPs.  Consequently, EKPs require a new IS design theory, as explicated by Walls et al. (1992).We created such a theory while designing and deploying a system for the EKP of organization design.  The system was demonstrated through subsequent empirical analysis to be successful in supporting the process.  Abstracting from the experience of building this system, we developed an IS design theory for EKP support systems.  This new IS design theory is an important theoretical contribution, because it both provides guidance to developers and sets an agenda for academic research.  EKP design theory makes the development process more tractable for developers by restricting the range of effective features (or rules for selecting features) and the range of effective development practices to a more manageable set.  EKP design theory also sets an agenda for academic research by articulating theory-based principles that are subject to empirical, as well as practical, validation.

'''A Dramaturgical Model of the Production of Performance Data'''

|issue=3
|page=723-723
|abstract = The production of performance data in organizations is often described as a functional process that managers enforce on their employees to provide leaders with accurate information about employees’ work and their achievements.  This study draws on a 15-month ethnography of a desk sales unit to build a dramaturgical model that explains how managers participate in the production of performance data to impress rather than inform leaders.  Research on management information systems is reviewed to outline a protective specification of this model where managers participate in the production of performance data to suppress information that threatens the image they present to leaders.  Ethnographic data about the production and use of performance records and performance reports in a desk sales unit is examined to induce an exploitive specification of this dramaturgical model.  This specification explains how people can take advantage of the opportunities, rather than just avoid the threats that performance data presents for impression management.  It also demonstrates how managers can participate in the production of performance data to create an idealized version of their accomplishments and that leaders reify these data by using them in their own attempts at impressing others.  By doing so, leaders and managers turn information systems into store windows to show achievement upward instead of transparent windows to monitor compliance downward.12/03/12

'''A Fast Form Approach to Measuring Technology Acceptance and Other Constructs'''

|year= 2008
|volume=32
|issue=4
|page=687-687
|abstract = Nearly all prior studies on the technology acceptance model (TAM) have used Likert scales to measure the model’s constructs, but the use of only this type of scale has two shortcomings.  One is that such use prevents us from exposing the model’s constructs to a robust test of their measure and relationships to each other, termed their nomological validity.  The other is that such use leaves us unsure about whether or not we have selected an efficient way, in terms of survey completion time, to assess these constructs.  Past researchers have used short form scales to address the issue of efficiency, but there are problems that may result from such efforts.  In this study, we address both shortcomings by exploring the use of a semantic differential scale, which we refer to as a fast form, to assess the constructs of TAM.  In this regard, we do three things.  First, we describe how fast form as a scale may be developed.  Second, we conduct a psychometric evaluation of the constructs that are measured by the fast form and examine their relationships.  Third, we assess the efficiency of the fast form by comparing the time required to complete a survey with it to that which is required to complete a survey with Likert scales.  Our results confirm that the constructs that are measured by the fast form are psychometrically equivalent to those that are measured by the Likert scales.  The relationship among these constructs was unchanged, providing strong evidence for nomological validity.  The fast form also yielded a 40 percent reduction in the survey completion time, proving its superior efficiency.  We conclude with a description of the implications of these results for research and practice.

|abstract = This article examines the relationship between interpersonal trust and virtual collaborative relationship (VCR) performance.  Findings from a study of 10 operational telemedicine projects in health care delivery systems are presented.  The results presented here confirm, extend, and apparently contradict prior studies of interpersonal trust.  Four types of interpersonal trust—calculative, competence, relational, and integrated—are identified and operationalized as a single construct.  We found support for an association between calculative, competence, and relational interpersonal trust and performance.  Our finding of a positive association between integrated interpersonal trust and performance not only yields the strongest support for a relationship between trust and VCR performance but also contradicts prior research.  Our findings indicate that the different types of trust are interrelated in that positive assessments of all three types of trust are necessary if VCRs are to have strongly positive performance.  The study also established that if any one type of trust is negative, then it is very likely that VCR performance will not be positive.  Our findings indicate that integrated types of interpersonal trust are interdependent, and the various patterns of interaction among them are such that they are mutually reinforcing.  These interrelationships and interdependencies of the different types of interpersonal trust must be taken into account by researchers as they attempt to understand the impact of trust on virtual collaborative relationship performance.

|abstract = This article reports on a series of interviews on end user computing carried out in twenty locations in St. Louis. The interviews took place between December 1982 and March 1983. Sixty-seven end users from all levels of management and nineteen IS professionals were interviewed in their work locations regarding the practice of interactive computing by non-DP professionals.Though end user computing is still in its early stages, signs of rapid growth are present. In response to this growth, IS departments are attempting to develop policies for its control and support. The picture is complicated by the recent introduction of microcomputers to the business office. The study explores this new phenomenon and examines some of the differences between those who use the mainframe environment and those who use micro-computers. Software used, the varieties of applications developed, and the training background of end users are examined, as well as some of the problems encountered and some of the early results.A prime objective of the study is accomplished in identifying end users’ educational goals. Finally, five critical issues are identified which those interviewed saw as needing resolution in the near future.

'''A Field Study of Organizational Factors Influencing DSS Success'''

|issue=1
|page=77-77
|abstract = A field study involving 124 organizations, and 378 DSS users, was conducted to ascertain the influence of the user’s task environment on DSS success.  Three groups were analyzed in the study:  managers, financial and planning analysts (FPA’s), and “others” who were predominantly management scientists or data processing analysts.  The study focused on three factors discussed in the MIS literature as potential, but unsubstantiated contributors to DSS success:  decision context (degree of problem structure), level of task interdependence (degree of interaction with others), and level of task constraints (degree of decision maker authority and autonomy).  There was some evidence that the decision context and the level of task interdependence were moderately related to decision-making success for managers and others.  There was very little support found to substantiate a relationship between the level of task constraints and DSS success for any group in the study.  The results reaffirmed that the level of top management support, user training, and length of DSS use are important correlates of DSS success.

|issue=2
|page=69-69
|abstract = The Information Systems Development Life Cycle (ISDLC) is usually treated as a rigid sequence of activities. This article asserts that differences in the nature of development projects should affect the planning of the ISDLC. Two classes of factors affecting the ISDLC are identified: factors relating to the environment and factors relating to the development effort (e.g. in-house development vs. canned software package). Each step along the ISDLC is decomposed into several dimensions relating to the activities that should be performed, the degree of control that should be exerted, to human resources, to other resources, and to the time factor.  The relationship between the six dimensions and the two classes of factors are explained. Finally, a practical approach to ISDLC planning is suggested based on a structured procedure and a number of working forms. It assists in preliminary planning of the development process as well as in periodic reviews and revisions whenever the project reaches a certain milestone.

|abstract = This article proposes a comprehensive framework for comparing the current methodologies and tools for information engineering and using these methods for applying information technology to construct the overall information systems architecture for the organization.  The proposed framework consists of two dimensions:  (1) an expanded sequence of the traditional system life cycle; and (2) the conceptual depth of the methods.The article shows that information engineering is the key to effective information management.  Using the proposed framework, 26 widely cited methods for information engineering are compared.  Evolution to more effective methods of information engineering are needed to align future information systems requirements to strategic goals and objectives of an organization and to exploit the current information systems technologies for competitive advantage.

The author proposes that conventional statistics on the performance of MIS software development groups are too often based upon norms and procedures relevant to groups developing systems-oriented software. To evaluate the statement a simple descriptive framework is presented which distinguishes software developmental attributes for MIS from those of other computer software systems. The framework is validated by data from twenty-four organizations and the implications for management of MIS software development are discussed.

Proponents are recognizing its potential value to the manager as an information resource, in addition to its initial focus on improved clerical operations.  However, proponents are recommending office automation as an information system without citing any basis, theoretical or empirical, for their claims.  The authors construct a theoretical framework that may be useful to the manager, or the system designer, in channeling office automat efforts in the right direction.  The framework is based on Henry Mintzberg’s concept of managerial roles, and is presented in the context of data gathered from five senior executives.

|year= 2012
|volume=36

|abstract = In this paper, we present a method to make personalized recommendations when user preferences change over time.  Most of the works in the recommender systems literature have been developed under the assumption that user preference has a static pattern.  However, this is a strong assumption especially when the user is observed over a long period of time.  With the help of a data set on employees’ blog reading behavior, we show that users’ product selection behaviors change over time.  We propose a hidden Markov model to correctly interpret the users’ product selection behaviors and make personalized recommendations.  The user preference is modeled as a hidden Markov sequence.  A variable number of product selections of different types by each user in each time period requires a novel observation model.  We propose a negative binomial mixture of multinomial to model such observations.  This allows us to identify stable global preferences of users and to track individual users through these preferences.  We evaluate our model using three real-world data sets with different characteristics.  They include data on employee blog reading behavior inside a firm, users’ movie rating behavior at Netflix, and users’ music listening behavior collected through last.fm.  We compare the recommendation performance of the proposed model with that of a number of collaborative filtering algorithms and a recently proposed temporal link prediction algorithm.  We find that the proposed HMM-based collaborative filter performs as well as the best among the alternative algorithms when the data is sparse or static.  However, it outperforms the existing algorithms when the data is less sparse and the user preference is changing.  We further examine the performances of the algorithms using simulated data with different characteristics and highlight the scenarios where it is beneficial to use a dynamic model to generate product recommendation.

|year= 2012
|volume=36

|page=865-865
|abstract = In this paper, we adopt the lens of absorptive capacity (ACAP), defined by two dimensions—the knowledge base (consisting of knowledge diversity, depth, and linkages) and routines (consisting of sensing and experimentation)—to explain how a software firm’s knowledge endowments influence its level of radical information technology innovation during a technological breakthrough.  We distinguish three types of IT innovations—base, processes, and service innovation—that form an innovation ecology.  We posit that (1) ACAP is a relational construct where the impact of the knowledge base is mediated by routines; (2) IT innovations are either externally adopted or internally generated; and (3) knowledge antecedents associated with different types of innovations differ.  We hypothesize a three-step, mediated path (knowledge base à sensing à experimentation à innovation) for external innovation adoption, and a two-step path (knowledge diversity/depth à experimentation à innovation) for internal innovation creation to explain the software firm’s level of radical innovation across three IT innovation types.  We validate the model through a cross-sector study that examined how 121 small software firms innovated with Internet computing.  We confirm the mediated nature of ACAP for external base innovations, which are driven by all three knowledge-based factors as follows:  (1) knowledge depth (direct positive effect); (2) knowledge diversity (mediated three-step path), (3) knowledge linkages (mediated three step path).  Process innovations are externally driven by a three-step mediated path for knowledge linkages, as well as being directly affected by knowledge diversity, but negatively and directly impeded by knowledge depth.  Service innovations are not driven by any mediated influence of ACAP, but driven directly by knowledge diversity.  At the same time, both service and process innovations are strongly influenced by prior IT innovations:  base and/or service.  Several directions for future studies of radical IT innovation are proposed.

|abstract = While technology adoption in the workplace has been studied extensively, drivers of adoption in homes have been largely overlooked.  This paper presents the results of a nation-wide, two-wave, longitudinal investigation of the factors driving personal computer (PC) adoption in American homes.  The findings revealed that the decisions driving adoption and non-adoption were significantly different. Adopters were driven by utilitarian outcomes, hedonic outcomes (i.e., fun), and social outcomes (i.e., status) from adoption.  Non-adopters, on the other hand, were influenced primarily by rapid changes in technology and the consequent fear of obsolescence.  A second wave of data collection conducted six months after the initial survey indicated an asymmetrical relationship between intent and behavior, with those who did not intend to adopt a PC following more closely with their intent than those who intended to adopt one.  We present important implications for research on adoption of technologies in homes and the workplace, and also discuss challenges facing the PC industry.

'''A Longitudinal Study of Herd Behavior in the Adoption and Continued Use of Technology'''

{{article
|author= Heshan Sun,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2013
|volume=37
|issue=4
|page=1013-1013
|abstract = Herd literature suggests that people tend to discount their own beliefs and imitate others when making adoption decisions and that the resulting adoption decisions are fragile and can be easily reversed during the post-adoptive stage.  This helps explain why the adoption of a number of new technologies―from Amazon’s Kindle, to Apple’s iPod, iPhone, and iPad, to various types of Web 2. 0 technologies―appears to have adoption patterns similar to those of new fashion trends (i. e., an initial en masse acquisition followed by subsequent abandonment).  It is important to understand these phenomena because they are strongly related to the staying power of technology.  From a herd behavior perspective, this study proposes two new concepts, namely discounting one’s own information and imitating others, to describe herd behavior in technology adoption. A research model is developed to describe the conditions under which herd behavior in technology adoption occurs, how it impacts technology adoption decision making, and how it influences post-adoptive system use.  A longitudinal study is conducted to examine the research model.  Findings from this research suggest that the discounting of one’s own beliefs and the imitating of others when adopting a new technology are provoked primarily by the observation of prior adoptions and perceptions of uncertainty regarding the adoption of new technology.  Herd behavior has a significant influence on user technology adoption; however, it does not necessarily lead to the collapse of the user base, as predicted in the herd literature.  Instead, imitation can help reduce post-adoption regret and thus serve as a legitimate strategy for choosing a good enough technology, which may or may not be the best option to enhance job performance.  People tend to adjust their beliefs when herding and also to revive their discounted initial beliefs to modify their beliefs about the technology at the post-adoptive stage.  Findings from this study have significant research and practical implications.10/08/12

'''A Matter of Life and Death:  Exploring Conceptualizations of Sociomateriality in the Context of Critical Care'''

{{article
|author= Matthew Jones,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2014
|volume=38
|issue=3
|page=895-895
|abstract = Sociomateriality has been attracting growing attention in the Organization Studies and Information Systems literatures since 2007, with more than 140 journal articles now referring to the concept.  Over 80 percent of these articles have been published since January 2011 and almost all cite the work of Orlikowski (2007, 2010; Orlikowski and Scott 2008) as the source of the concept.  Only a few, however, address all of the notions that Orlikowski suggests are entailed in sociomateriality, namely materiality, inseparability, relationality, performativity, and practices, with many employing the concept quite selectively.  The contribution of sociomateriality to these literatures is, therefore, still unclear.  Drawing on evidence from an ongoing study of the adoption of a computer-based clinical information system in a hospital critical care unit, this paper explores whether the notions, individually and collectively, offer a distinctive and coherent account of the relationship between the social and the material that may be useful in Information Systems research.  It is argued that if sociomateriality is to be more than simply a label for research employing a number of loosely related existing theoretical  approaches, then studies employing the concept need to pay greater attention to the notions entailed in it and to differences in their interpretation.9/27/13

'''A Meta-Analysis of the Role of Environment-Based Voluntariness in Information Technology Acceptance'''

|year= 2009
|volume=33
|issue=2
|page=419-419
|abstract = The technology acceptance model (TAM) asserts that ease of use and usefulness are two primary determinants of behavioral intention and usage. A parallel research stream emphasizes voluntariness, a key social influence and contextual variable, as a critical factor in information technology (IT) adoption, but pays little attention to its role in TAM.  This paper addresses this particular absence by investigating the impact of environment-based voluntariness on the relationships among the four primary TAM constructs. A meta-analysis of 71 empirical studies provides strong support for the hypotheses that environment-based voluntariness moderates the effects of ease of use and usefulness on behavioral intention, but not the effect of ease of use on usefulness. Moreover, inconsistent with our expectations, environment-based voluntariness does not moderate the effects of ease of use and usefulness on usage. By further analyzing the data set, we suggest this may be because of the relatively small sample size, the presence of other factors, or the inappropriate measurement of usage in previous studies. The current study contributes not only to the distinction between user-based and environment-based voluntariness but also to a more complete understanding of user acceptance of IT across system-use environments.

|abstract = Management of the software development process requires a thorough understanding of the environment in which development takes place.   Ability to estimate, plan, and manage resource consumption is limited by the central problem of determining the size of system specifications.  To address this issue, a general strategy for measurement and evaluation of system development environments needs to be established.  This article presents a research model that will help managers and researchers understand and establish the linkages between units of systems requirements specification, design, and source code.  Initial validation of the model was performed by reverse engineering systems written in a fourth generation language from source code to design metrics.  Results indicate that the model may provide reliable measures of system size in terms of both design metrics and lines of code.

'''A Model of Users' Perspective on Change:  The Case of Information Systems Technology Implementation'''

{{article
|author= Kailash Joshi,

|year= 1991
|volume=15
|issue=2
|page=229-229
|abstract = Change is a fundamental theme in human life.  Yet some organizational behavior and MIS researchers have noted that individuals generally resist changes.  MIS researchers have also attributed many implementation problems to users’ resistance to change.  However, there is no fundamental resistance to every change.  Individuals readily adopt changes such as a pay raise or promotion.  This article proposes that individuals attempt to evaluate most changes.  Changes that are considered favorable are not resisted and may even be sought after and welcomed, while changes considered unfavorable are likely to be resisted.  The equity-implementation (E-I) model provides a theory-based understanding of information systems users’ resistance to change.  It describes the processes employed by users in assessing the change associated with the implementation of an information system or technology in an organization.  The model is based upon equity theory, which is a well-established and widely used theory in social sciences.  Users employ three levels of analysis in evaluating the change introduced by an implementation.  At the first level of analysis, a user is viewed as assessing a change in terms of the gain or loss in his or her equity status.  At the second level of analysis, the user is viewed as comparing his or her relative outcomes with that of the organization.  Finally, at the third level of analysis, the user is viewed as comparing hi or her relative outcomes with that of other users in the reference group.  Users who evaluate the change to be unfavorable in terms of inequity or loss of equity are likely to be distressed by the change and resist it.  The E-I model provides a useful framework of analysis for improving our understanding of users’ assessment of a change.  Managers will find the model useful for overcoming resistance to change during implementation.

|abstract = This paper develops a long-term, multi-project model of factors affecting organizational benefits from enterprise systems (ES), then reports a preliminary test of the model.  In the shorter-term half of the model, it is hypothesized that once a system has gone live, two factors, namely functional fit and overcoming organizational inertia, drive organizational benefits flowing from each major ES improvement project. The importance of these factors may vary from project to project. In the long-term half of the model, it is hypothesized that four additional factors, namely integration, process optimization, improved access to information, and on-going major ES business improvement projects, drive organizational benefits from ES over the long term.  Preliminary tests of the model were conducted using data from 126 customer presentations from SAP’s 2003 and 2005 Sapphire U.S. conferences. All six factors were found to be important in explaining variance in organizational benefits from enterprise systems from the perspective of senior management.

|abstract = The shift toward sustainable electricity systems is one of the grand challenges of the 21st century.  Decentralized production from renewable sources, electric mobility, and related advances are at odds with traditional power systems where central, large-scale generation of electricity follows inelastic consumer demand.  Information systems innovations can enable new forms of dynamic electricity trading that leverage real-time consumption information and that use price signals to incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors.  However, the best designs for these innovations, and the societal implications of different design choices, are largely unclear.  We are addressing these challenges through the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC), a competitive gaming platform on which numerous research groups now jointly devise, benchmark, and improve IS-based solutions to the sustainable electricity challenge.  Based on the Power TAC community’s results, we give preliminary empirical evidence for the efficacy of competitive gaming platforms, and for the community’s contributions toward resolving the sustainable electricity challenge.09/29/15

'''A Multilevel Model for Measuring Fit Between a Firm's Competitive Strategies and Information Systems Capabilities'''

{{article

|year= 2011

|page=909-909
|abstract = To compete in a highly dynamic marketplace, firms must frequently adapt and align their competitive strategies and information systems.  The dominant literature on the strategic fit of a firm’s information systems focuses primarily on high-level measures of the strategic fit of a firm’s overall IS portfolio and the impact of fit on business performance.  This paper addresses the need for a more fine-grained approach for assessing the specific areas of misfit between a firm’s competitive strategies and IS capabilities.  We describe the design and evaluation of a multilevel strategic fit (MSF) measurement model that enables researchers and practitioners to measure the strategic fit of a firm’s information systems at both an overall and a detailed level. The steps in the model include identifying the relevant IS capabilities according to the type of system; measuring the current level of support for each capability using a capabilities instrument; identifying the ideal level of support for each capability using an adaptation of Conant et al.’s (1990) instrument to assess strategic archetype; and comparing the ideal and realized level of support for each capability.  Evidence from a multiple case study analysis indicates that the fine-grained assessment of strategic fit can strengthen the validity, utility, and ease of corroboration of the strategic fit measurement outputs.  The paper also demonstrates how an iterative design science research approach, with its emphasis on evaluating the utility of prototype artifacts, is well suited to developing field-tested and theoretically grounded measurement models and instruments that are accessible to practitioners.  This focus on practical utility in turn provides researchers with results that can be more readily corroborated, thus improving the quality and usefulness of the research findings.

'''A Multilevel Model of Resistance to Information Technology Implementation'''

|author= Suzanne Rivard Liette Lapointe,

|year= 2005
|volume=29
|issue=3
|page=461-461
|abstract = To better explain resistance to information technology implementation, we used a multilevel, longitudinal approach.  We first assessed extant models of resistance to IT.  Using semantic analysis, we identified five basic components of resistance:  behaviors, object, subject, threats, and initial conditions.  We further examined extant models to (1) carry out a preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between these components and (2) refine our understanding of the multilevel nature of the phenomenon.  Using analytic induction, we examined data from three case studies of clinical information systems implementations in hospital settings, focusing on physicians’ resistance behaviors.  The resulting mixed-determinants model suggests that group resistance behaviors vary during implementation.  When a system is introduced, users in a group will first assess it in terms of the interplay between its features and individual and/or organizational-level initial conditions.  They then make projections about the consequences of its use.  If expected consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors will result.  During implementation,  should some trigger occur to either modify or activate an initial condition involving the balance of power between the group and other user groups, it will also modify the object of resistance, from system to system significance.  If the relevant initial conditions pertain to the power of the resisting group vis-à-vis the system advocates, the object of resistance will also be modified, from system significance to system advocates.  Resistance behaviors will follow if threats are perceived from the interaction between the object of resistance and initial conditions.  We also found that the bottom-up process by which group resistance behaviors emerge from individual behaviors is not the same in early versus late implementation.  In early implementation, the emergence process is one of compilation, described as a combination of independent, individual behaviors.  In later stages of implementation, if group level initial conditions have become active, the emergence process is one of composition, described as the convergence of individual behaviors.

'''A Multimedia Solution to Productivity Gridlock:  A Re-Engineered Jewelry Appraisal System at Zale Corporation'''

|page=21-21
|abstract = Zale corporation once melted down most of its damaged, returned, or repossessed jewelry, resulting in substantial lost revenues.  It was determined that additional revenue could be produced from salvageable jewelry if the value of the items could be accurately determined.  This meant the jewelry had to be appraised by experienced gemologists to determine the most profitable disposition.  The gemologists’ productivity suffered because the appraisal was extremely labor intensive.  To address this problem, an automated multimedia system utilizing electronically linked measuring instruments, voice recognition, and interconnected LAN databases was developed.  Although the unique voice recognition feature of the system was later abandoned, the use of the system enhanced productivity.  This paper describes the systems development, its subsequent evolution, and the lessons learned form the process.

{{article
|author= John S. Chandler,

|year= 1982
|volume=6
|issue=1
|page=61-61
|abstract = An information system can be viewed as a symbiotic relationship between the users of the system and the system itself. Ideally, an information system should be evaluated with equal consideration given to both user constraints and to system constraints. The approach described in this article provides the analyst with a framework for gaining insight into information system performance from both user and system viewpoints by establishing a causal relationship between user goal attainment and system activity. This approach produces not only measures of current performance, but also predictive measures of future performance.The approach is based on a multiple goal programming formulation of the information system design evaluation problem. This article presents an overview of the formulation and its interpretation. The focus is on the analysis of an example system facilitated by this approach. A discussion of the applicability of the approach concludes this article.

|issue=4
|page=405-405
|abstract = A growing problem for many organization sis spiraling telecommunications costs coupled with the need to respond faster to changing market conditions.  To handle such a situation, TRW’s Space and Defense Sector management authorized a new integrated voice and data digital network for 20,000 employees located in 65 buildings.  TRW’s top management saw the network as an opportunity to integrate the company’s islands of information, which were isolated within separate data networks.  The project took four and one half years from design to implementation at a cost of $45 million.  The management techniques employed resulted in critical milestones being met not only on time but also 10 percent under the original budget.  The new network provided a single access mechanism that resulted in some unanticipated advantages that went beyond the original goals of fast response and cost containment.  The network successfully addressed such problems as developing effective data networking policies, network sizing in a multi-vendor environment, sharing excess information system capacity, centralizing the network while keeping the information systems decentralized, and overcoming the “not controlled here” syndrom.  TRW’s experiences should prove valuable for large information-intensive companies attempting to meet similar challenges.

|page=179-179
|abstract = This article presents a systematic methodology for requirements analysis in database design. The procedure begins with an interview with the user/decision maker. The responses collected during the interview are analyzed to represent, by means of a diagram, the data and processing requirements for the activity under consideration. The diagram uses two fundamental constructs, events and states, as building blocks. It depicts any temporal or causal relationships, as well as logical operators, that maybe present in the process underlying the activity. The representation is compact and easy to follow. An experimental study is described to illustrate the applicability of the methodology.

|abstract = Star Enterprise is a joint venture partnership between Texaco Inc. and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company.  Created in 1988, it became fully operational on January 1, 1989.  This new organization inherited staff, facilities, and information resources existing within Texaco Inc. at the time of formation.  A significant opportunity for the new organization was to create a new Enterprise Information Technology Architecture to support business functions and management decision making.  While this venture was an opportunity, it was also a challenge because of the existing information technology that was comprised of incompatible hardware and nonintegrated systems.  This paper describes the architecture that emerged and reviews its current status.  Two major contributions of the paper are to identify the principles upon which the architecture is being created and to review what has been learned to date in the process of implementing the architecture.

|abstract = Empirical research is an important methodology for the study of conceptual modeling practices.  The recently published article “Representing Part–Whole Relations in Conceptual Modeling:  An Empirical Evaluation” (Shanks et al. 2008) uses the lens of ontology to study a relatively sophisticated aspect of conceptual modeling practice, the representation of aggregation and composition.  It contends that some analysts argue that a composite should be represented as a relationship while others argue that a composite should be represented as an entity.  We find no evidence of such a dispute in the data modeling literature.  We observe that composites are objects.  By definition, all object-types should be represented as entities.  Therefore, using the relationship construct to represent composites should not be seen as a viable alternative.  Additionally, we found significant conceptual and methodological issues within the study that call its conclusions into question.  As a way to offer insight into the requisite methodological procedures for research in this area, we conducted two experiments that both explicate and address the issues raised.  Our results call into question the utility of using ontology as a foundation for conceptual modeling practice.  Furthermore, they suggest a contrary but at least equally plausible explanation for the results reported by Shanks et al.  In conducting this work we hope to encourage dialogue that will be beneficial for future endeavors aimed at identifying, developing, and evaluating appropriate foundations for the discipline of conceptual modeling.

This paper develops the concept of IT as an organizational capability and empirically examines the association between IT capability and firm performance. Firm specific IT resources are classified as IT infrastructure, human IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles. A matched-sample comparison group methodology and publicly available ratings are used to assess IT capability and firm performance. Results indicate that firms with high IT capability tend to outperform a control sample of firms on a variety of profit and cost-based performance measures.

|abstract = In this paper we propose rhetoric as a valuable yet underdeveloped alternative paradigm for examining IT diffusion.  Building on recent developments of computerization movements theory, our rhetorical approach proposes that two central elements of the theory, framing and ideology, rather than being treated as separate can be usefully integrated.  We suggest that IT diffusion can be usefully explored through examining the interrelationship of the deep structures underlying ideology and the type and sequence of rhetorical claims underpinning actors’ framing strategies.  Our theoretical developments also allow us to better understand competing discourses influencing the diffusion process.  These discourses reflect the ideologies and shape the framing strategies of actors in the broader field context.  We illuminate our theoretical approach by drawing on the history of the diffusion of free and open source software.

|abstract = Qualitative research is just as able as quantitative research to follow certain fundamental principles of logic in general and scientific reasoning in particular.  Two such principles are the logic of modus ponens and the logic of modus tollens. In this essay, we frame different research approaches— positivist research, interpretive research, action research, and design research—in the forms of modus ponens and modus tollens.  Three issues emerge from this framing and call into question how research is now conducted in the discipline of information systems.  They are the issue of a common scientific basis, the issue of the fallacy of affirming the consequent, and the issue of summative validity.  Both rigor and relevance in information systems research may be better achieved by attending to the three issues.

|abstract = A methodology for conducting the case study of a management information system (MIS) is presented.  Suitable for the study of a single case, the methodology also satisfies the standard of the natural science model of scientific research.This article provides an overview of the methodological problems involved in the study of a single case, describes scientific method, presents an elucidation of how a previously published MIS case study captures the major features of scientific method, responds to the problems involved in the study of a single case, and summarizes what a scientific methodology for MIS case studies does, and does not, involve.The article also has ramifications that go beyond matters of MIS case studies alone.  For MIS researchers, the article might prove interesting for addressing such fundamental issues as whether MIS research must be mathematical, statistical, or quantitative in order to be called “scientific.”  For MIS practitioners, the article’s view of scientific method might prove interesting for empowering them to identify, for themselves, the pint at which scientific rigor is achieved in an MIS research effort, and beyond which further rigor can be called into question, especially if pursued at the expense of professional relevance.

|issue=1
|page=39-39
|abstract = Selecting from the many currently available systems development methodologies (SDMs) and development techniques is a difficult problem with economic, technical, and behavioral implications. A quantitative approach to the selection problem is represented.The selection model begins with a definition of a superset of functions expected of a systems development tool. Functions are then weighted, using a Delphi approach to achieve acceptable valuations among system managers. Next, each approach under consideration is evaluated with respect to each function desired. After scores are computed for each methodology, economic and qualitative aspects such as training availability and cost can be used to differentiate the highest ranked alternatives.The four-person MBA project team from the Graduate School of Management at the University of Minnesota, with the guidance from authors, applied the model to a methodology selection problem. In addition to producing a quantitative ranking of competing methodologies, the approach described furthered understanding of the functions to be performed by the methodologies being considered. It also gained acceptance, admittedly reluctant, of the recommended methodology from managers who strongly advocated their own favorites.

|abstract = The shift to more distributed forms of organizations and the prevalence of interorganizational relationships have led to an increase in the transfer of knowledge between parties with asymmetric and incomplete information about each other.  Because of this asymmetry and incompleteness, parties seeking knowledge may not be able to identify qualified knowledge providers, and the appropriate experts may fail to be motivated to engage in knowledge transfer.We propose a sender–receiver framework for studying knowledge transfer under asymmetric and/or incomplete information. We outline four types of information structures for knowledge transfer, and focus on the sender-advantage asymmetric information structure and the symmetric incomplete information structure. We develop formal game-theoretical models, show how information incompleteness and asymmetry may negatively influence knowledge transfer, and propose solutions to alleviate these negative impacts. Implications for knowledge transfer research and practice are also discussed.

|abstract = This article discusses the conduct and evaluatoin of interpretive research in information systems.  While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies.  A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale.  The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature.  The intention of the paper is to further reflect and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.

|abstract = While criteria or principles for conducting positivist and interpretive research have been widely discussed in the IS research literature, criteria or principles for critical research are lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a set of principles for the conduct of critical research in information systems. We examine the nature of the critical research perspective, clarify its significance, and review its major discourses, recognizing that its mission and methods cannot be captured by a fixed set of criteria once and for all, particularly as multiple approaches are still in the process of defining their identity.  However, we suggest it is possible to formulate a set of principles capturing some of the commonalities of those approaches that have so far become most visible in the IS research literature.  The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by analyzing three critical field studies in information systems.  We hope that this paper will further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding critical research methodology.

|abstract = Drawing from the social and relational perspectives, this study offers an innovative conceptualization and operational approach regarding the validation of self-reported customer demographic data, which has become an essential corporate asset for harnessing business intelligence.  Specifically, based on social network and homophily paradigms in which individuals have a natural tendency to associate and interact frequently with others with similar characteristics, we constructed a relational inference model to determine the accuracy of self-administered consumer profiles.  In addition, to further enhance the reliability of our model’s prediction capability, we employed the entropy mechanism that minimizes potential biases that may arise from a simple probabilistic approach.  To empirically validate the accuracy of our inference framework, we obtained and analyzed over 20 million actual call transactions supplied by one of the largest global telecommunication service providers.  The results suggest that our social network-based inference model consistently outperforms other competing mechanisms (e.g., weighted average and simple relational classifier) regardless of the criteria choice (e.g., number of call receivers, call duration, and call frequency), with an accuracy rate of approximately 93 percent.  Finally, to confirm the generalizability of our findings, we conducted simulation experiments to validate the robustness of the results in response to variations in parameter values and increases in potential noise in the data.  We discuss several implications related to business intelligence for both research and practice, and offer new directions for future studies.

'''A Social Process Model of User-Analyst Relationships'''

|issue=2
|page=249-249
|abstract = The development of an information system is a social process involving users and systems analysts, carried out in an organizational setting.  This paper presents a process model of user-analyst relationships to guide research into the social dynamics of system development.  The model identifies antecedent conditions, encounters, episodes, and outcomes over the course of a project.  The model asserts that established relationships between analysts and users will persist unless critical encounters change the trajectory of the project.  By conceiving of systems development as a series of encounters and episodes, researchers may identify critical encounters and study the connections between preceding events and their consequences.  Practitioners may use the model to diagnose problems and to enact critical encounters that move a project in a different direction.  The descriptive and predictive capacities of the process model are illustrated with two case studies.

'''A Stochastic Dominance Approach to Risk Analysis of Computer Systems'''

|page=363-363
|abstract = Auditors and systems analysts are increasingly called upon to determine the impact of a disaster striking the computer system.  Current risk analysis methods rely on some variation of expected value analysis.  The expected value method suffers from serious drawbacks in this application because probabilities of disaster are difficult to estimate and the loss distributions are likely to be highly skewed.  This article presents an improved methodology for dealing with EDP risk analysis and contingency planning.  It is based on the concept of stochastic dominance and it provides a more accurate comparison of the various contingency plans by dealing with estimates of the entire loss distribution.  This methodology also focuses on the differences between contingency plans, rather than on the cause of the disaster.  The application of this methodology is illustrated for the case of a hypothetical medium-sized bank using aggregated data.

|issue=3
|page=295-295
|abstract = Information systems can serve as intermediaries between the buyers and the sellers in a vertical market, thus creating an “electronic marketplace.”  A major impact of these electronic market systems is that they typically reduce the search costs buyers must pay to obtain information about the prices and product offerings available in the market.  Economic theory suggests that this reduction in search costs plays a major role in determining the implications of these systems for market efficiency and competitive behavior.  This article draws on economic models of search and examines how prices, seller profits, and buyer welfare are affected by reducing search costs in commodity and differentiated markets.  This reduction results in direct efficiency gains from reduced intermediation costs and in indirect but possibly larger gains in allocational efficiency from better-informed buyers.  Because electronic market systems generally reduce buyers’ search costs, they ultimately increase the efficiency of interorganizational transactions, in the process affecting the market power of buyers and sellers.  The economic characteristics of electronic marketplaces, in addition to their ability to reduce search costs, create numerous possibilities for the strategic use of these systems.

|abstract = An emerging body of research in group decision support systems (GDSS) provides evidence that computer technology can and does impact the quality of decision making in groups.  Most GDSS research is oriented toward examining the effects of a computer system on group outcomes, typically decision quality or group consensus, with the process itself often treated as a “black box.”  The research reported in this article addresses the need for a closer, micro-level examination of group process.  An important group variable, namely influence behavior, was isolated and examined at various levels and by multiple methods.A model of specific GDSS effects on influence behavior was developed, based on an information exchange view of decision making and on the impact of a GDSS as a communication channel.  Based on the research questions of interest in the study, several propositions and hypotheses were advanced and empirically tested on a specific implementation of a GDSS.  Results were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively.  The major empirical findings of the study showed no significant difference between the overall amount of influence behavior attempted in computer-supported versus unsupported groups, although significant differences were found in the pattern of influence behaviors, i.e., the different types of behaviors used.  In addition, the distribution of influence behavior was more even in GDSS groups than in unsupported groups in one of two measures used.  Empirical findings partially supported th research model, with indications that decision-making groups need more active guidance in understanding how to adapt computer support technology to their view of decision-making processes.

'''A Study of the Relationship Between Decision Model Naturalness and Performance'''

|abstract = Two objectives in the design of decision support systems (DSS) are to improve decision-making performance and to use DSS modeling forms that are natural, that is, to adopt modeling paradigms that are congruent with decision makers’ conceptual models of decision tasks.  By accomplishing the latter objective, a DSS should enjoy better conceptual ease of use and face validity.  However, past research finds that DSS deemed natural for a task by decision makers, DSS designers, and researchers alike, often do not improve (or even hinder) performance; the inverse also occurs.  Further decision-making behavior seems quite sensitive to minor task differences.  How reliably are decision model natural ness and performance related?  This study utilizes the bootstrapping paradigm of psychological research to help answer this question.  In assessing the naturalness and performance of differing model paradigms over time and across levels of task complexity, no single, systematic pattern emerges.  But the results suggest that naturalness and performance are differentially sensitive to task contingencies.  For example, while relative performance is stable over time only in the low complexity condition, relative naturalness is stable over time only int the intermediate complexity condition.  One implication of the results is that conceptual ease of use may be an unreliable predictor of a DSS’s effect on performance.  DSS mechanisms may help decision makers better analyze model naturalness and performance.

The goal of this study involved determining the telecommunication technologies and services currently used by business firms. The results show that firms are using intelligent terminals, satellites, microwave, local area networks, etc., and they are using these technologies for electronic mail, decision support system activities, and limited use of video teleconferencing. Information resource management in most of these firms is centralized. Hands-on use of terminals by managers and professional does not appear as widespread as commonly publicized to date.

|abstract = Requirements analysis (RA) involves end users and systems analysts interacting in an effort to recognize and specify the data and information needed to develop an information system.  In the design of expert systems, a similar process of eliciting information, in this case human knowledge, has been studied under the banner of knowledge acquisition (KA).  When examined closely, many entities and processes involved in RA and KA are almost identical.  However, researchers in each area are seemingly unaware of the developments in the other area.  In order to facilitate a merged awareness of both research streams, this article compares representative RA and KA techniques, which are grouped, according to elicitation mode, on three dimensions:  communication obstacles, a technique’s focus of control, and the nature of the understanding gained from using the technique.  This comparison demonstrates that these two research streams have many things in common and that researchers in one area can benefit from developments in the other area.  Additionally, this analysis leads to several suggested research areas:  (1) rigorous examinations of these techniques as they are used to overcome communication obstacles and to enrich understanding; (2) investigations into the seeming match between certain elicitation types and problem domain categories; (3) examinations into synergetic effects of elicitation techniques; (4) development of more techniques for eliciting information requirements to serve emerging needs; and (5) comparisons of the relative advantage of generalized versus specialized elicitation techniques.

|page=501-501
|abstract = In this study, we propose that perceived website complexity (PWC) is central to understanding how sophisticated features of a website (such as animation, audio, video, and rollover effects) affect a visitor’s experience at the site. Although previous research suggests that several elements of perceived complexity (e.g., amount of text, animation, graphics, range and consistency of web pages configuring a website, ease of navigating through it, and clarity of hyperlinks) affect important user outcomes, conflicting results yielded by previous research have created an important debate:  does complexity enhance or inhibit user experience at a website.  In this study, we draw on the task complexity literature to develop a broad and holistic model that examines the antecedents and consequences of PWC. Our results provide two important insights into the relationship between PWC and user outcomes. First, the positive relationship between objective complexity and PWC was moderated by user familiarity. Second, online task goals (goal-directed search and experiential browsing) moderated the relationship between PWC and user satisfaction. Specifically, the relationship between PWC and user satisfaction was negative for goal-directed users and inverted-U for experiential users. The implications of this finding for the practice of website design are discussed.

|abstract = Our knowledge of how users reinvent information technologies (IT) in ways that depart from their intended purposes to achieve new goals is relatively limited.  Drawing on a human agency theory that situates actors in the flow of time, this paper develops a theory of IT reinvention.  It identifies the key subprocesses of IT reinvention, describes two patterns of reinvention (performance-oriented and mastery-oriented), and explains how the present and the past influence the ambiguities, demands, and dilemmas inherent to each pattern.  The outcomes associated with each pattern of IT reinvention are also discussed.  The paper provides the theoretical foundations to understand how users reinvent IT as well as new insights into a broader range of post-adoption behaviors. 12/18/15

|abstract = The characteristics of a group's task have been shown to account for more than half the variation in group interaction. In the context of group support systems (GSS), the importance of task has been underscored by the recommendation that achieving a fit between task and technology should be a principle for effective GSS use. Although the body of group support systems research has grown in recent years, and experience with different tasks and technologies now exists, no generally accepted theory of task/technology fit has emerged. This paper develops a theory of task/technology fit in GSS environments based on attributes of task complexity and their relationship to relevant dimensions of GSS technology. Propositions to guide further research are developed from the theory.

'''A Three-Perspective Model of Culture, Information Systems, and Their Development and Use'''

{{article
|author= Suzanne Rivard Antonio Kappas,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2008
|volume=32
|issue=3
|page=601-601
|abstract = Culture plays an increasingly important role in information systems initiatives, and it receives considerable attention from researchers who have studied a variety of aspects of its role in IS initiatives.  Notwithstanding the contributions of research to date, our knowledge of how culture influences— and is influenced by—the development and use processes and an information system itself remains fragmented.  Knowledge fragmentation is amplified by the fact that conceptualizations of culture differ among researchers.  Indeed, most researchers agree that culture consists of patterns of meaning underlying a variety of manifestations.  Researchers diverge, however, on the degree of consensus on these interpretations that they assume to be reached within a collective.  In order to integrate these divergent conceptualizations of culture, we adopt the view that no single perspective is sufficient to capture the complexity of interplay between culture, the processes of developing and using an IS, and the IS itself.  We have, therefore, adopted a conceptualization that views culture from three perspectives—integration, differentiation, and fragmentation—that come into play simultaneously and jointly.  Using this conceptualization, the paper synthesizes what is known about the role of culture in IS initiatives, and proposes a model of the relationships between culture, the development and use processes, and an information system.

|abstract = The problem of detecting whether two behavioral constructs reference the same real-world phenomenon has existed for over 100 years.  Discordant naming of constructs is here termed the construct identity fallacy (CIF).  We designed and evaluated the construct identity detector (CID), the first tool with large-scale construct identity detection properties and the first tool that does not require respondent data.  Through the adaptation and combination of different natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, six designs were created and evaluated against human expert decisions.  All six designs were found capable of detecting construct identity, and a design combining two existing algorithms significantly outperformed the other approaches.  A set of follow-up studies suggests the tool is valuable as a supplement to expert efforts in literature review and meta-analysis.  Beyond design science contributions, this article has important implications related to the taxonomic structure of social and behavioral science constructs, for the jingle and jangle fallacy, the core of the Information Systems nomological network, and the inaccessibility of social and behavioral science knowledge.  In sum, CID represents an important, albeit tentative, step toward discipline-wide identification of construct identities.3/17/16

|year= 2016

|abstract = In this paper, we introduce a tree-based approach adjusting for observable self-selection bias in intervention studies in management research.  In contrast to traditional propensity score (PS) matching methods, including those using classification trees as a subcomponent, our tree-based approach provides a standalone, automated, data-driven methodology that allows for (1) the examination of nascent interventions whose selection is difficult and costly to theoretically specify a priori, (2) detection of heterogeneous intervention effects for different pre-intervention profiles, (3) identification of pre-intervention variables that correlate with the self-selected intervention, and (4) visual presentation of intervention effects that is easy to discern and understand.  As such, the tree-based approach is a useful tool for analyzing observational impact studies as well as for post-analysis of experimental data.  The tree-based approach is particularly advantageous in the analyses of big data, or data with large sample sizes and a large number of variables.  It outperforms PS in terms of computational time, data loss, and automatic capture of nonlinear relationships and heterogeneous interventions.  It also requires less user specification and choices than PS, reducing potential data dredging.  We discuss the performance of our method in the context of such big data and present results for very large simulated samples with many variables.  We illustrate the method and the insights it yields in the context of three impact studies with different study designs:  reanalysis of a field study on the effect of training.04/11/16

|abstract = This paper develops a sociomaterial perspective on digital coordination.  It extends Pickering’s mangle of practice by using a trichordal approach to temporal emergence.  We provide new understanding as to how the nonhuman and human agencies involved in coordination are embedded in the past, present, and future.  We draw on an in-depth field study conducted between 2006 and 2010 of the development, introduction, and use of a computing grid infrastructure by the CERN particle physics community.  Three coordination tensions are identified at different temporal dimensions, namelyobtaining adequate transparency in the present, modeling a future infrastructure, and the historical disciplining of social and material inertias.  We propose and develop the concept of digital coordination, and contribute a trichordal temporal approach to understanding the development and use of digital infrastructure as being orientated to the past and future while emerging in the present.THIS IS AN OPEN ACCESS ARTICLE.

'''A Unified Economic Model of Standard Diffusion: The Impact of Standardization Cost, Network Effects, and Network Topology'''

|page=489-489
|abstract = This paper is motivated by the following question:  What drives the diffusion of a communication standard and what results can we expect?  Past literature provides many instructive but mostly unrelated answers.  Frequent findings are startup problems, penguin effects, and tendencies toward monopoly.  But substantial problems in applying the models to concrete standardization problems reveal that the dynamics are probably more complex.  Not all networks are ultimately conquered by a single standard once it has attracted a certain number of users.  And not all diffusion results are either complete or no standardization.We address the question of the conditions of particular diffusion behaviors by developing a formal standardization model that captures all fragmented phenomena in a unified approach.  Drawing from findings of other research, we incorporate the structure of the underlying user network as an important determinant for diffusion behaviors.  The approach allows us to disclose varying conditions that generate frequently observed standardization behaviors as special parameter constellations of the model.  Using equilibrium analysis and computer simulations we identify a standardization gap that reveals the magnitude of available standardization gains for individuals and the network as a whole.  The analysis shows that network topology and density have a strong impact on standard diffusion and that the renowned tendency toward monopoly is far less common.  We also report how the model can be used to solve corporate standardization problems.

|abstract = Absorptive capacity is a firm’s ability to identify, assimilate, transform, and apply valuable external knowledge.  It is considered an imperative for business success.  Modern information technologies perform a critical role in the development and maintenance of a firm’s absorptive capacity.  We provide an assessment of absorptive capacity in the information systems literature.  IS scholars have used the absorptive capacity construct in diverse and often contradictory ways.  Confusion surrounds how absorptive capacity should be conceptualized, its appropriate level of analysis, and how it can be measured.  Our aim in reviewing this construct is to reduce such confusion by improving our understanding of absorptive capacity and guiding its effective use in IS research.  We trace the evolution of the absorptive capacity construct in the broader organizational literature and pay special attention to its conceptualization, assumptions, and relationship to organizational learning.  Following this, we investigate how absorptive capacity has been conceptualized, measured, and used in IS research.  We also examine how absorptive capacity fits into distinct IS themes and facilitates understanding of various IS phenomena.  Based on our analysis, we provide a framework through which IS researchers can more fully leverage the rich aspects of absorptive capacity when investigating the role of information technology in organizations.

'''Absorptive Capacity Configurations in Supply Chains: Gearing for Partner-Enabled Market Knowledge Creation'''

|abstract = The need for continual value innovation is driving supply chains to evolve from a pure transactional focus to leveraging interorganizational partner ships for sharing information and, ultimately, market knowledge creation.  Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge.  This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems.  We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation.  Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities.Through an exploratory field study conducted in the context of the RosettaNet consortium effort in the IT industry supply chain, we use cluster analysis to uncover and characterize five supply chain partnership configurations (collectors, connectors, crunchers, coercers, and collaborators).  We compare their partner-enabled knowledge creation and operational efficiency, as well as the shortcomings in their capability platforms and the nature of information exchange.  Through the characterization of each of the configurations, we are able to derive research propositions focused on enterprise absorptive capacity elements.  These propositions provide insight into how partner-enabled market knowledge creation and operational efficiency can be affected, and highlight the interconnected roles of coordination information and rich information.  The paper concludes by drawing implications for research and practice from the uncovering of these configurations and the resultant research propositions.  It also highlights fertile opportunities for advances in research on knowledge management through the study of supply chain contexts and other interorganizational partnering arrangements.

'''Academic Data Collection in Electronic Environments: Defining Acceptable Use of Internet Resources'''
{{header}}
{{article
|author= Gordon B. Davis Dan L. Burk Gove N. Allen,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2006
|volume=30
|issue=3
|page=599-599
|abstract = Academic researchers access commercial web sites to collect research data.  This research practice is likely to increase.  Is this appropriate?  Is this legal?  Such commercial web sites are maintained to achieve business objectives; research access uses site resources for other purposes.  Web site administrators may, therefore, deem academic data collection inappropriate.  Is there a process to make research access more open and acceptable to web site owners and administrators?  These are significant issues.  This article clarifies the problems and suggests possible approaches to handle the issues with sensitivity and openness.Research access to commercial web sites may be manual (using a standard web browser) or automated (using automated data collection agents).  These approaches have different effects on web sites.  Researchers using manual access tend to make a limited number of page requests because manual access is costly to perform.  Researchers using automated access methods can request large numbers of pages at a low cost.  Therefore, web site administrators tend to view manual access and automated access very differently.Because of the number of accesses and the nonbusiness purpose, automated research requests for data are sometimes blocked by site administration using a variety of means (both technological and legal).  This paper details the pertinent legal issues including trespass, copyright violation, and breech of contract.  It also explains the nature of express and implied consent by site administration for research access.Based on the issues presented, guidelines for researchers are proposed to reduce objections to research activities, to facilitate communication with web site administration, and to achieve express or implied consent.  These include notification to web site administration of intended automated research activity, description of the research project posted as a web page, and clear identification of automated requests for web pages.  In order to encourage good research practices with respect to automated data collection, suggestions are made with respect to disclosing methods used in research papers and for self regulation by academic associations.

|abstract = The range of journals in which to publish scholarly papers in the management information systems (MIS) field has expanded over the years.  The perceived ranking of the journals by those in the field is an important issue to academics.  Another question of importance to academic personnel in the MIS field is whether the writing of books counts toward tenure and promotion.  This article presents the results of a survey relative to these two questions.  It was conducted in late 1989 and early 1990 among MIS professors in AACSB accredited business schools, with about half of all such schools participating.The survey found that the most highly regarded journals for IS research include an assortment of IS-specific, computer science, and management science journals.  This continues a long-standing tradition, despite the introduction of several new IS journals.  IT also showed that books are generally counted toward tenure and promotion.

'''Action Design Research'''

|abstract = Design research (DR) positions information technology artifacts at the core of the Information Systems discipline.  However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context.  Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase.  They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers’ intent.We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use.  The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently.  The essay describes the stages of ADR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.

|issue=4
|page=449-449
|abstract = This study evaluates the extent to which the added value to customers from a supplier's application of information technology (IT) is manifested through premium prices of a traded good. We demonstrate that IT can add value to an otherwise undifferentiated good and study how these benefits accrue to customers from the adoption of IT. Analyzing a case in which the traded good is a homogeneous commodity, commercial fueling, our data shows that the critical impacts of IT are convenience and control -- that is, convenience that provides improved access to fuel and control that reduces problems of delegating purchasing authority for the customer. The value of this additional service is exhibited in premium prices customers are willing to pay for the IT-enhanced traded good, relative to the same good without IT. Compared to the price without IT, statistical analysis of the supplier's pricing history demonstrates the application of IT to commercial fuel yielded price premiums of between five and 12 percent of the retail fuel price.

'''Addressing the Personalization-Privacy Paradox:  An Empirical Assessment from a Field Experiment on Smartphone Users'''

{{article
|author= Chee Wei Phang Chuan-Hoo Tan Elia Palme Juliana Sutanto,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2013
|volume=37
|issue=4
|page=1141-1141
|abstract = Privacy has been an enduring concern associated with commercial information technology (IT) applications, in particular regarding the issue of personalization.  IT-enabled personalization, while potentially making the user computing experience more gratifying, often relies heavily on the user’s personal information to deliver individualized services, which raises the user’s privacy concerns.  We term the tension between personalization and privacy, which follows from marketers exploiting consumers’ data to offer personalized product information, the personalization–privacy paradox.  To better understand this paradox, we build on the theoretical lenses of uses and gratification theory and information boundary theory to conceptualize the extent to which privacy impacts the process and content gratifications derived from personalization, and how an IT solution can be designed to alleviate privacy concerns.		Set in the context of personalized advertising applications for smartphones, we propose and prototype an IT solution, referred to as a personalized, privacy-safe application, that retains users’ information locally on their smartphones while still providing them with personalized product messages.  We validated this solution through a field experiment by benchmarking it against two more conventional applications:  a base non-personalized application that broadcasts non-personalized product information to users, and a personalized, non-privacy safe application that transmits user information to a central marketer’s server.  The results show that (compared to the non-personalized application), while personalized, privacy-safe or not  increased application usage (reflecting process gratification), it was only when it was privacy-safe that users saved product messages (reflecting content gratification) more frequently.  Follow-up surveys corroborated these nuanced findings and further revealed the users’ psychological states, which  explained our field experiment results.  We found that saving advertisements for content gratification led to a perceived intrusion of information boundary that made users reluctant to do so.  Overall our proposed IT solution, which delivers a personalized service but avoids transmitting users’ personal information to third parties, reduces users’ perceptions that their information boundaries are being intruded upon, thus mitigating the personalization–privacy paradox and increasing both process and content gratification.

'''Adoption of Electronic Health Records in the Presence of Privacy Concerns: The Elaboration Likelihood Model and Individual Persuasion'''
{{header}}
{{article
|author= Ritu Agarwal Corey M. Angst,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2009
|volume=33
|issue=2
|page=339-339
|abstract = Within the emerging context of the digitization of health care, electronic health records (EHRs) constitute a significant technological advance in the way medical information is stored, communicated, and processed by the multiple parties involved in health care delivery.  However, in spite of the anticipated value potential of this technology, there is widespread concern that consumer privacy issues may impede its diffusion. In this study, we pose the question:  Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns?  To investigate this question, we integrate an individual’s concern for information privacy (CFIP) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine attitude change and likelihood of opting-in to an EHR system.  We theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables.  We also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude.  We test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting EHRs.  We find that an individual’s CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of EHRs.  In addition, results suggest that attitude toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions.  An important finding for both theory and practice is that even when people have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing.  These results as well as other theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

'''Advertising Versus Brokerage Model for Online Trading Platforms'''

{{article
|author= Mingzhe Li Ming Fan Jianqing Chen,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2016
|volume=40
|issue=3
|page=575-575
|abstract = The two leading online consumer-to-consumer platforms use very different revenue models:  eBay.com in the United States uses a brokerage model in which sellers pay eBay on a transaction basis, whereas Taobao.com in China uses an advertising model in which sellers can use the basic platform service for free and pay Taobao for advertising services to increase their exposure.  This paper studies how the chosen revenue model affects the revenue of a platform, buyers’ payoffs, sellers’ payoffs, and social welfare.  We find that when little space can be dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, the brokerage model generates more revenue for the platform than the advertising model.  When a significant proportion of space is dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, matching probability on a platform plays a critical role in determining which revenue model can generate more revenue:  If the matching probability is high, the brokerage model generates more revenue; otherwise, the advertising model generates more revenue.  Buyers are always better off under the advertising model because of larger participation by the sellers in the platform’s free service.  Sellers are better off under the advertising model in most scenarios.  The only exception is when the matching probability is low and the platform dedicates considerable space to advertising.  Under these conditions, the sellers with payoffs similar to the marginal advertiser who is indifferent about advertising can be worse off under the advertising model.  Finally, the advertising model generates more social welfare than the brokerage model3/24/16

|page=711-711
|abstract = This research concentrates on visual complexity and order as central factors in the design of webpages that enhance users’ positive emotional reactions and facilitate desirable psychological states and behaviors.  Drawing on existing theories and empirical findings in the environmental psychology, human–computer interaction, and marketing research literatures, a research model is developed to explain the relationships among visual complexity and order design features of a webpage, induced emotional responses in users, and users’ approach behaviors toward the website as moderated by users’ metamotivational states.  A laboratory experiment was  conducted to test the model and its associated hypotheses.  The results of the study suggested that a web user’s initial emotional responses (i.e., pleasantness and arousal), evoked by the visual complexity and order design features of a webpage when first encountered, will have carry-over effects on subsequent approach behavior toward the website.  The results also revealed how webpage visual complexity and order influence users’ emotions and behaviors differently when users are in different metamotivational states.  The salience and importance of webpage visual complexity and order for users’ feelings of pleasantness were largely dependent on users’ metamotivational states.

|year= 1988
|volume=12
|issue=3
|page=353-353
|abstract = This article discusses the evolution of airline reservation systems – from their inception as manually maintained inventories of seat availability, through their description as “anticompetitive weapons” used “unlawfully” to obtain and exercise monopoly power.  The evolutionary perspective reveals interdependent industry, company, and technology forces that shaped the pattern of competition.  Although many facets of the airline experience are unique to the air transport industry, the authors identify three features with broad implications for the strategic use of information technology.  First, large installed processing capacity can be a source of economies of scale and scope.  Second, established technical competence is a necessary requirement for gaining competitive advantage.  Finally, sustainable advantage need not be the result of extraordinary vision, but the result of consistent exploitation of opportunities revealed during the evolution of adaptable systems.

|abstract = Although increasing evidence suggests that superior performance requires alignment between firms’ strategies and production processes, it is not known if such alignment is relevant for software development processes.  This study breaks new ground by examining how firms align their software processes, products, and strategies in Internet application development.  Drawing upon the literatures in strategy, operations management, and information systems, we identify four dimensions that influence alignment:  the business unit strategy, the level of product customization, the level of process customization, and the volume of customers.  To examine how these dimensions are synchronized, we conducted detailed case studies of Internet application development in nine varied firms including both start-ups and established “brick and mortar” companies.  Our analyses reveal that the firms in our study do use differing processes for Internet application development, and that many of the firms match their software process choices to product characteristics, customer volume, and business unit strategies.  We develop concept maps for the firms that are in alignment to illustrate how managers configure specific product and process dimensions.  We also offer potential explanations for why some firms are misaligned, such as attempting to execute incompatible strategies, the lack of coordination between marketing and production strategies, the too rapid expansion of process scope, and inflexible barriers to rapid adaptation of process.  Our study contributes detailed insights into how software processes are customized to complement different types of product requirements and strategies.

'''Aligning the IT Human Resource with Business Vision: The Leadership Initiative at 3M'''

|year= 2000

|page=327-327
|abstract = Increasingly, business leaders are demanding that IT play the role of a business partner and a strategic enabler. In such an environment, IT human capital has assumed considerable significance. Insightful IT leaders recognize that the greatest impediments to success are often related to people rather than to information, technology, and systems. What is not quite clear to IT leaders, however, is exactly how to develop and leverage this human capital in support of business needs. The transformation of IT from a back-office support role to a strategic business partner requires new roles and competencies for IT leaders and professionals. Key challenges for IT leaders are to envision these roles and competencies and to develop and implement programs to translate this vision to reality. This paper describes the IT human resource vision that is guiding such a transformation at 3M—a large multi-product, diversified manufacturing firm (1998 sales: $15 billion)—and focuses on the implementation of its leadership initiative. This initiative was instrumental in not only allowing 3M to develop needed skills and behaviors among its IT professionals, it also helped 3M evade an industry-wide recruitment and retention trend. The major conceptual models guiding the leadership initiative as well as implementation details are presented. Challenges encountered on the way and the lessons learned from the journey are discussed. 3M’s experiences provide opportunities for managers in other organizations to develop valuable insights regarding the management of human capital in IT.

|abstract = Identifying the best way to organize the IS functions within an enterprise has been a critical IS management issue since the mid-1980s. Yet to date, MIS researchers have offered little empirical evidence on which to base guidelines for the practitioner. This study seeks to explain a firm's IS organization design decision for a decentralized, centralized, or "hybrid" locus of responsibility from an expanded set of environmental, overall organizational, and IS-specific antecedants as well as a larger concept of organizational alignment. Potential antecedents are selected from prior contingency research and the IS literature; other variables emerge from the data collection. Data collected via on-site interviews from IS and general managers in six multi-divisional firms, paired by industry, confirm that centralized, decentralized, and hybrid IS structures exist -- but often not in ''pure'' form -- and that industry type is not a strong predictor. Data was also collected via survey form on the importance of potential antecedents for a recent IS design change in each firm. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data, four configurations are discussed; patterns of antecedents that are associated with (1) highly centralized or (2) highly decentralized IS structures; and patterns of antecdents that explain a firm's choice to (3) decentralize of (4) recentralize systems development and application planning functions in particular. A model based on these configurations is then proposed. The article concludes with implications for researchers and practioners .

|abstract = Multinational corporations (MNCs) face increasingly higher rewards and risks when choosing amongst alterative investments for their computer and communications based information systems. The multi-layered management and technical issues and decisions confronting multinational corporations are seemingly endless and require new insights.A rapidly growing number of MNCs are utilizing computer based information systems, office automation and administrative support systems, telecommunications systems, factory information systems, and home information systems as critical tools in managing and monitoring their global businesses. As the resources, scope, and criticality of the “information commodity” grow, more senior managers are being forced to concentrate on better ways of planning for rapid changes to capitalize on new opportunities and reduce their risks.The conclusions and recommendations presented in this article are based on an examination of the actual information resource management (IRM) planning and coordination practices of 25 large multinational corporations as well as an indepth review of two case studies.

|issue=3
|page=243-243
|abstract = This article reports results from a study that examined the implementation of computerized modeling systems in 29 organizations.  The focus is on the use of various MIS effectiveness measures that are reported in MIS research.  Specifically, we examine the relationship between user perceived effectiveness measures (user satisfaction) and behavioral measures of system effectiveness (system use).While much of the existing MIS research implies that the two types of measures are positively associated with each other, the results from this study indicate otherwise.  By using a perceived effectiveness instrument that is strongly grounded in a widely accepted theoretical model, the results provide important insights into the nature of this relationship.The importance of interpreting perceived and behavioral measures of system effectiveness is demonstrated by examining the effect of system sophistication on MIS effectiveness.

|abstract = AMANDA, an acronym for Automated Management of Document Access, is a completely online intraorganizational document based retrieval system. It is both a reference system, in that an indexed summary of surrogate of a document is created and stored for retrieval by computer, and a full text system, and in that the complete document can be entered, searched, and retrieved if needed.AMANDA is capable of handling a wide variety of document types (e.g., letter, memo, report, contract, reprint, book) by tailoring an organizational communication. A system which widens the channels of communication and helps to integrate disjoint functions provides large and complex organizations the means of overcoming a basic operational deficiency.AMANDA is currently in active use within several departments at American Critical Care, a division of American Hospital Supply Corporation. Departments at other divisions access the system from remote sites.

'''Ambient Awareness and Knowledge Acquisition:  Using Social Media to Learn "Who Knows What" and "Who Knows Whom"'''

{{article
|author= Paul M. Leonardi,
|source= MIS Quarterly
|year= 2015
|volume=39
|issue=4
|page=747-747
|abstract = The argument proffered in this paper is that use of enterprise social networking technologies can increase the accuracy of people’s metaknowledge (knowledge of “who knows what” and “who knows whom”) at work.  The results of a quasi-natural field experiment in which only one of two matched-sample groups within a large financial services firm was given access to the enterprise social networking technology for six months revealed that by making people’s communications with specific partners visible to others in the organization, the technology enabled observers to become aware of the communications occurring amongst their coworkers and to make inferences about what and whom those coworkers knew based on the contents of the messages they sent and to whom they were sent.  Consequently only individuals in the group that used the social networking technology for six months improved the accuracy of their metaknowledge (a 31% improvement in knowledge of who knows what and an 88% improvement in knowledge of who knows whom).  There were no improvements in the other group over the same time period.  Based on these findings, how technologically enabled “ambient awareness”—awareness of ambient communications occurring amongst others in the organization—can be an important antecedent for knowledge acquisition is discussed.8/20/15
