<p>ABSTRACT: This paper presents techniques of integrating statistical procedures and computer graphics for decision support. Characteristics of good statistical support are defined. Experience in the design and implementation of systems in two companies is related to illustrate how the techniques can facilitate the creation of effective computerized decision support systems. Software modules were developed that enable nontechnical analysts to utilize sophisticated statistical procedures and complex models with a few simple commands. By integrating computer graphics and computer cartography with tools for statistical modeling, superior analytical tools were created.</p>
