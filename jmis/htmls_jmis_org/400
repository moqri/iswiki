<p>ABSTRACT: The concept of a collaborative human-computer interchange was proposed almost thirty years ago. The goal of this paradigm is to design human-computer decision-making systems that think and process information at a level exceeding that of either the human or the computer alone. Technological and conceptual developments have made this holistic partnership increasingly possible. Moreover, recent discussions of human-computer collaborative work have highlighted the system performance advantages of this interchange. In this paper, the notion of human-computer interchange protocols is developed and the importance of these protocols to human-computer collaboration and system performance is argued. Based on data collected in a laboratory setting, empirical support for the proposed holistic effect of human-computer interchange protocols on system performance is provided. Decision performance is significantly improved by interchange protocols that encourage human-computer interaction during the problem-solving process.</p>
