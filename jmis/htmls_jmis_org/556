<p>ABSTRACT: The article comments on decision support systems (DSS) and knowledge-based systems (KBS). In the author's view neither has yet to fulfill its promise. DSS, he believes, has been marked by both literature of a self-congratulatory nature, and systems that do little to address practical problems. Similar could be said for KBS. Going forward, however, he believes both can be valuable and mutually sustaining avenues of inquiry. He sees the two as complementary, with KBS informed and given direction by DSS.</p>
