 E-commerce, or the use of the Internet and the Web to conduct business, is typically categorized into business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and intraorganizational e-business. Businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations are increasingly investing in information technology (IT) infrastructures to be able to conduct digitally enabled transactions. Online shoppers, constituting the B2C segment, spent a record $18.5 billion during the 2003 holiday season, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, representing a 35 percent increase from 2002 [6]. All indications are that e-commerce will continue to grow in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
 While we have witnessed promising growth in the B2C area, there is a tremendous opportunity for generating business value from B2B e-commerce.  Moreover, a few traditional businesses, such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Dell, and Wal-Mart, have been successful in integrating e-commerce into their traditional bricks-and-mortar business models. However, many other companies still struggle with implementing and justifying e-commerce initiatives [2]. Managers primarily worry about falling behind in the implementation of e-commerce initiatives, yet the business value of these initiatives needs justification. The evidence on both the success and failure of such initiatives has been generally anecdotal. This calls for rigorous empirical research examining the payoff realized from e-commerce initiatives.
</p>
<p>
 There is a rich body of literature on the business value of IT investment in traditional bricks-and-mortar business environments [1, 2, 4, 11]. However, these studies have been conducted in different contexts, at various levels of analysis, and have examined various metrics of business value [3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12]. Although the insights provided by this body of work in the context of the traditional business environment have been invaluable, they fall far short of furnishing an adequate answer to the question of whether an IT investment generates business value in the new Net-enabled business environment. This is especially complicated by the fact that the Net-enabled environment, which harnesses the power of the Internet and Web-based technologies, challenges some of the traditional frameworks, models, and metrics. Thus, there is a need to examine theories, frameworks, and metrics in the e-business environment. Even as businesses hasten to make their operations e-business enabled, the fundamental question that is often unanswered is&#8212;how does this initiative provide business value?
</p>
<p>
 The four research papers included in this JMIS Special Section represent contributions from some of the prominent researchers in the business value of e-commerce area. These papers were selected from a large number of submissions following a rigorous review process by expert reviewers in the discipline. They reflect an important milestone in the examination of e-business value.
</p>
<p>
 Leading off this Special Section is a paper by Zhu, Kraemer, Xu, and Dedrick. The authors, drawing on a technology&#8211;organization&#8211;environment framework, present a research model for assessing the business value of e-business initiatives at the firm level. Using survey data from 612 companies in the financial industry across 10 countries, the authors test a number of hypotheses. Their results provide us with a number of interesting findings. First, technology readiness is the strongest factor that contributes to e-business value, while financial resources, global scope, and regulatory environment also contribute significantly. Second, firm size is negatively related to e-business value. Third, e-business value is associated more with internal organizational resources such as technological readiness as opposed to competitive pressure from outside. Fourth, for launching an e-business, financial resources and government regulations are more important in developing countries, while technological capabilities are much more important in developed countries. The authors provide thoughtful recommendations for managers and policy-makers to help them launch and manage an e-business.
</p>
<p>
 Dehning, Richardson, Urbaczewski, and Wells use an event study method to reexamine the value relevance of e-commerce announcements. They find evidence to support the notion that the traditional event study method, during periods of high market volatility, does not provide an accurate measure of abnormal returns. They propose an alternative method that takes into account extreme or unusual market movements in the period in which the e-commerce announcement is made. They show that their alternative method allows them to more accurately measure the change in a leading indicator (e.g., equity price) that is directly related to an individual event (e.g., e-commerce announcement). The authors claim that their technique gives researchers and investors a better tool for measuring e-business value during conditions of high industry and market volatility.
</p>
<p>
 Straub, Rai, and Klein argue that since, in recent years, the economy seems to be shifting to a networked organizational model, and firms are increasingly outsourcing functions and services and partnering with suppliers and intermediaries, it is critical to measure the performance of entire networks of firms, as opposed to measuring the performance of just individual firms. The authors then explore several dimensions of networked organizational performance as a construct within a nomology and as a set of measures. They  offer numbered, tiered, and layered perspectives to networked interorganizational exchanges in a digital supply network. They validate measures for a dyadic view of network performance. Their present research in this area offers a way to gather crucial information about how partners work together in sharing strategic information and about how performance across an entire network can be measured and thereby improved.

 Kohli, Devaraj, and Mahmood examine the impact of Simon&#8217;s decision-making stages on consumers&#8217; decision-making in B2C online shopping using 134 online consumers. The online channel providers continue to explore innovative ways to anticipate consumers&#8217; need for an efficient shopping experience. By extending Simon&#8217;s decision-making model to include cost savings, time savings, and consumers&#8217; satisfaction with the online channel, the authors examine support for the revised model. They use a structural equation modeling approach to analyze their data. Their results indicate that the online shopping channel supported the overall decision-making process of B2C consumers. In particular, the authors found strong support for the design and choice phases of online consumers&#8217; decision-making process. The results also indicate that the support for the decision-making process was mediated by the cost savings and time savings gained by the online consumers and led to the greater satisfaction of the online channel.
</p>
<p>
 Collectively, the four papers included in this Special Section exemplify the challenges in the e-business environment and the application of new frameworks, metrics, and methods needed to address these in the contexts examined. Two of these studies examine the business value of e-business initiatives at the firm level. One examines the financial services industry (Zhu, Kraemer, Xu, and Dedrick) and the other reexamines the value relevance of e-commerce announcements using an alternative event study methodology (Dehning, Richardson, Urbaczewski, and Wells). While Straub, Rai, and Klein present metrics and analyses that can be employed to assess performance and value in digital supply networks, Kohli, Devaraj, and Mahmood show that value, from the online consumer&#8217;s perspective, can be examined using an established decision-making model. In summary, these four papers present diverse perspectives on the business value of IT in e-business environments while providing valuable managerial implications. The Special Issue of the International Journal of Electronic Commerce, to appear as the fall 2004 issue, will be a continuation of this Special Section. Collectively, these investigations will help spur further research in the area.
