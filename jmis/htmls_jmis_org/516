<p>ABSTRACT: A primary assumption of decision support systems (DSS) is that their use will result in more effective decision making. Using a repeated measures design, we conducted an experimental gaming study to investigate the effect of user-developed DSS applications on the decision maker's ability to forecast his or her actual gaming results. The findings of this study support the proposition that user-developed DSS models lead to more effective decision making. Subjects in the DSS modeling group made significantly better forecasts of their firm's performance than did those in the nonmodeling group.</p>
