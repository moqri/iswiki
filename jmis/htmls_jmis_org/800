 OVER THE LAST DECADE, companies have abandoned legacy systems in favor of a new class of  comprehensive packaged application software designed to integrate the core corporate activities of an  organization. Variously called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, enterprise-wide systems, or  enterprise systems, ERP systems are the software tools used to manage all the enterprise's data, and to  provide information to those who need it when they need it. These systems help organizations deal with their  supply chain: receiving, inventory management, customer order management, production planning and  managing, shipping, accounting, human resource management, and all other activities that take place in a  modern business [4, 13]. The benefits of a properly selected and implemented ERP system can be significant. On average, inventory  costs can be reduced by 25 to 30 percent; raw material costs can be reduced by about 15 percent. Lead-time  for customers, production time, and production costs can be reduced as well [5, 6, 11]. However, the cost of  implementing these software packages can be quite high. Software, incremental hardware, training, and  implementation support may cost $200,000 for a smaller company with approximately $10 million annual sales,  $600,000 to $800,000 for midsized companies with approximately $40 million to $70 million annual sales, and  up to several million dollars for larger companies. It has been suggested that approximately $300 billion has  been invested in ERP worldwide in the last decade, and the enterprise applications market is projected to reach  $79 billion by 2004 [3].  Despite these high expectations and huge investments, ERP implementations often fail. The New York Times  printed an article, "Software That Can Make a Grown Company Cry" [5], describing problems with ERP  implementations. Allied Waste Industries purchased an ERP software package from SAP America, a major  ERP software vendor, but discontinued its use after finding it too complicated, too expensive, and a poor  value in terms of added functionality [2]. By doing so the firm lost over $40 million. Hershey Foods  Corporation installed an ERP application early in 1999. By mid-September of that year, the candy-making giant  was having trouble pushing orders through the new system, resulting in shipment delays and incomplete  orders during the busy Halloween season. One reason for these failures is that the implemented ERP systems did not fit organizational needs. In spite of  the fact that some ERP vendors argue that their software can suit most organizations [2], not all information  systems (IS) are equal, nor are all ERP packages used equally. Several studies [8, 9, 10] suggest that the  benefit an organization derives from using information technology (IT) is dependent on the characteristics of  the organization. Therefore, not all companies will gain the same benefit from using the same ERP  applications, and different ERP software packages will better suit different organizations. In addition, other  issues (such as, implementation, linkage to customers) affect the success of ERP. The three papers in this special section present contemporary and rapidly evolving research focusing on ERP  systems. The value for academic researchers lies with the findings presented and with the opportunity to use  these papers as avenues for future research. Practitioners will be able to use the findings of these studies to  better plan and use ERP systems, especially as they encounter three problem areas: the change that ERP  brings to an organization, the use of ERP as a platform for other applications, and measuring the effect of  ERP on firm performance.  A key implication of ERP is that it involves sweeping changes to a company's organization, business  practices, and core competencies. Few companies begin the project with the required organizational dynamics  and business practices in place. The method of introducing the systems into companies might well make the  crucial difference between successful organizational transformation and an abandoned project. Many of the  issues involved in implementation are not so much technical as they are people-related and culture-related.  The first paper, "Learning to Implement Enterprise Systems: An Exploratory Study of the Dialectics of  Change," by Daniel Robey, Jeanne W. Ross, and Marie-Claude Boudreau, attempts to help organizations  understand ERP system implementation. The authors adopt a process theory perspective with a focus on the  dialectics of organizational learning that generates change in a comparative case study of 13 industrial firms.  Demands associated with change require substantial organizational learning. It was observed that firms have  identified various mechanisms for overcoming configuration and assimilation knowledge barriers associated  with the implementation. The paper concludes by identifying the implications of their research for the theory  and practice of systems implementation. An important role of ERP is to serve as a platform for other applications, such as Customer Relationship  Management (CRM). The vision for ERP extends beyond the organization, providing support for enhancements  cutting across whole industries. Despite the size of the CRM market, which is said to have grown 70 percent  in 1999, and is expected to become worth over $12 billion by 2004 [12], limited information exists on the  progress of diffusion of the CRM innovation. The second article, "Implementation Team Responsiveness and User Evaluation of Customer Relationship  Management: A Quasi-Experimental Design Study of Social Exchange Theory," by David Gefen and Catherine  M. Ridings, deals with user-level issues, which, according to industry reports, account for a large proportion of  the estimated 65 percent of CRM implementation failures. This study examines the social exchange aspects  of CRM implementation by using a quasi-experimental design. Gefen and Ridings describe some of the  complexity of CRM implementation and the relationship between users and the implementation team. The  findings suggest that the nature of the social exchange during implementation of a CRM influences user  assessments about the CRM and ultimately user willingness to adopt it. Moreover, the effect of actual and  perceived responsiveness on user willingness to adopt the new system is mediated through user beliefs about  the correctness of the configuration. Measuring the benefits from an enterprise system is a difficult task, particularly when the benefits of these  systems are strategic in nature. Understanding the value of an ERP system entails examining the amount of  duplicated effort that the ERP system eliminates and the increased efficiency that results from having an  ERP solution in place. Savings can be derived from a reduction in staff numbers and productivity  improvement. ERP helps companies control their purchasing, inventory, manufacturing, finance, and human   resource activities by centralizing information collected from dispersed geographical sites. A year after  implementing ERP, Par Industries in Moline, Illinois, reduced lead-time, increased on-time delivery  performance, decreased work-in-progress inventory, and the life of a shop floor order went from weeks to  hours [1]. Despite successes like this, many organizations are not certain that they will realize positive returns.  Even worse, many fail to see immediate benefits from moving to ERP or experience adverse effects, such  as missed sales and profit targets [7].  The final article, "Investment in Enterprise Resource Planning: Business Impact and Productivity Measures,"  by Lorin M. Hitt, D.J. Wu, and Xiaoge Zhou, is an empirical study dealing with the research question, What  theoretical understanding do we really have about the relationship between adopting ERP systems and firm  performance? The authors were able to collect and analyze a set of responses from firms that have purchased  licenses for the SAP R/3 system from which they confirm some important conjectures about the business  value of ERP implementations. Besides explaining the business impact of ERP implementation on a wide  variety of performance measures, the authors empirically test for the productivity and business performance  effects of ERP on firms that adopted ERP versus those that did not, and on firms before, during, and after  implementation to assess performance over time. They determined that ERP adopters are consistently higher  than non-adopters in performance across a wide variety of measures. Most of the gains occur during the  implementation period, although they find some evidence of a decline in business performance and  productivity shortly after completion of the implementation. Likewise, adopters had higher market valuations  both during and after adoption. In closing, we offer special thanks to a number of people who supported our work on this Special Section.
