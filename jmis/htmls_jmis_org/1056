<p>ABSTRACT: This study is an attempt to examine the efforts of a governmental agency, namely, the United States Postal Service, to compete in the high technology field against the private sector. The study seeks to highlight the impact of technological, political, legal, and economic problems. A hoped-for by-product is producing some lessons for guidance in similar future ventures. The paper surveys the rapidly advancing and highly competitive electronic mail market and the use of telecommunication networks in the leading companies in the private sector. The Postal Service approach to competition in the market and its managerial policy for dealing with this technological evolution in information delivery are also examined. Recommendations are made based on the capabilities, competitive position, and cost-demand structure of the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
