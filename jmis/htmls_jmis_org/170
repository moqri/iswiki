<p>ABSTRACT: The article presents a study of chief information officers (CIOs), which focuses on changes in the position's leadership role from a supply-oriented to demand-oriented model. The trend toward information technology (IT) as a commodity which can be outsourced has led to CIOs becoming more involved in business strategy planning at the senior executive level. A staged maturity model of the CIO role is presented as a means of analyzing this transition, from IT as an operations-oriented support function to the strategic deployment of IT to achieve a competitive advantage. Matched CIO responses from over 150 corporations were used to identify aspects of this process, such as human capital, CIO structural power, and organizational support for IT.</p>
