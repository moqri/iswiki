<p>ABSTRACT: <p>
 THE RECENT RAPID AND ONGOING ADVENT OF INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE and superhighways in  many nations is prompting fast transformation of organizations toward the virtual workplace. As the growth in the  virtual workplace and teleworking accelerate, organizations face new challenges to cope with their new  organizational structure. Some of these new challenges include understanding the emergent work environment,  the changing social work order, and the dynamic requirements of the knowledge worker. Indeed, it is challenging  for organizations to manage the complexity of the new social and work structures, which is exacerbated by the  increasing mobility of the new type of office worker. To meet these challenges effectively, management needs to  develop strategies to support what is called "moving work to where people are, rather than people to where the  work is." Thus, in order to maintain its status quo and also to be comparatively competitive, management must not  only understand the
</p>
<p>
 new structure but also take innovative steps to adopt new organizational forms and arrangements to  accommodate the increasingly diverse workplace.
</p>
<p>
 Companies no longer talk about "work at home" programs. Rather, they are speaking about "working  anywhere, anytime, and with anyone." The concept is fast becoming a reality where the use of information  technologies makes connectivity, collaborations, and communication easy. Does it matter whether that critical  voice-mail or message comes from the home office, the client's office, the airport, or the middle of a traffic jam?  The workplace environment is changing. These changes may have minimal effects on some people, yet, for  others, they may bring about radical changes in their workspace, and in their life-styles and habits.

 This Special Section discusses how individuals and groups function in the new environment. We are very  grateful to the authors who submitted their work and to the many reviewers who have provided constructive  comments and suggestions.

 In the first paper, Mary Beth Watson Fritz, Sridhar Narasimhan, and Hyeun-Suk Rhee examine the relationships  between organizational factors and individual satisfaction with office communication among telecommuters and  traditional office workers. Their study was conducted through a survey of telecommuters and a comparison  group of non-telecommuters in nine firms with telecommuting programs. The authors found that telecommuters  report higher satisfaction with office communication than do non-telecommuters. However, organizational factors  such as task predictability, IT support, and electronic coordination are found to have similar influences on  satisfaction with communication for both groups. The authors conclude that managers should develop strategies  for managing a network of distributed workers (i.e., workers in a variety of different geographic locations) and  suggest a number of different managerial actions. In addition, they suggest a number of areas for future  research.

 Sirkka L. Jarvenpaa, Kathleen Knoll, and Dorothy E. Leidner explore the antecedents of trust in a global virtual  team setting, using seventy-five teams in different countries. They argue that trust can be predicted by  perceptions of other team members' ability, integrity, benevolence, and propensity to trust. The relative importance  of these predictors may vary by time and phases of teamwork. The authors found that, in the early phases of  teamwork, team trust was predicted more strongly by integrity and benevolence. The salience of perceived ability  on trust diminished over time. They found that the members' own propensity to trust had a significant, although  unchanged, effect on trust. The authors also report that high-trust teams exhibit "swift trust." Finally, the authors  provide several suggestion to reinforce trust and eventually improve team process outcome.

 In the final paper of the Special Section, Alan R. Dennis, Sridar K. Pootheri, and Vijaya L. Natarajan address  the development of a Web-groupware system in building virtual communities. They discuss the analysis, design,  and implementation of the system and the results of series of interviews with users. They found that Web-based  groupware can improve communication among the participants and help to build virtual communities. However,  organizations should be aware that technology alone cannot build virtual communities. They report that  Web-groupware is a pull technology that requires users deliberately to access the system. In cases where users  did not find a compelling need or desire to interact, the system did not help to build a virtual  community.
