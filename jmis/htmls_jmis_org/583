<p>ABSTRACT: This research investigated whether implemented information technology (IT) innovation could best be explained by a general tendency among middle managers to create implemented business innovation or by experience with IT. The results indicated that middle managers responsible for implemented business innovation also generated IT innovation while managers' practical (hands-on or delegated) use of IT was not shown to result in more implemented IT innovation. Middle managers who actively used support functions (secretaries, staff, or IT experts) for help and discussion of IT-related issues created and implemented a greater amount of IT innovation. Implemented business and IT innovations related to the variables of attitude toward change and peer recognition for their implemented innovations but not to internal and external networking. Peers recognized their fellow managers for their implemented business innovation but not for their IT-related achievements.</p>
