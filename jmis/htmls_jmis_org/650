<p>ABSTRACT: The use of the critical success factor (CSF) method has been suggested by several sources as a means of ensuring the success of an organization. An investigation was performed to determine the existence and nature of CSFS for information centers (IC). Twenty-six CSFS were determined from various sources. The importance of each was rated in a survey of IC managers, and a principal components analysis was performed to indicate the underlying structure. This paper reports the effect on the composite CSFS of the IC variables age, size, and hardware option supported.</p>
