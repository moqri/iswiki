He also serves there as associate  dean of research and deputy director of the Living Analytics Research Center. He is also a  Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Center for Digital Strategies of the Tuck School of Business,  Dartmouth College. Previously he was on the faculty at Arizona State University, the University of  Minnesota, New York University, and the University of Rochester. He also visited in the Research  Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and worked in international banking and  finance prior to beginning his academic career. His articles have recently appeared in Information  Systems Research, Journal of Management Information Systems, MIS Quarterly, IBM Research and  Development Journal, Decision Support Systems, and Review of Economics and Statistics. Dr.  Kauffman's research focuses on technology and strategy, the economics of IT, technology in  financial services and e-business, managerial decision making, and innovations in research methods.  He served as a co-chair for the 2011 ICIS Doctoral Consortium and will also do this for the 2012  ACM SIGMIS Doctoral Dissertation Award Competition. He played a similar role for the 2012  Summer Institute on Analytics for Business, Consumer and Social Insights at Living Analytics  Research Centre (LARC), and the 2012 International Conference on Electronic Commerce in  Singapore in August 2012.

 ONE OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGES OVER THE PAST DECADE has been the way networks have enabled  the distributed generation of value and how businesses and organizations have managed to capture a  portion of this value. This has resulted in a plethora of innovative business ideas and new strategies.  The present special section deals with the incentives for distributed content generation;  counterintuitive network effects in the security software market, which features an intrinsic negative  externality; and the possibility for collaboration between different platforms in a two-sided market.  The included papers offer an interesting mix of theoretical and practical insights. All of the  contributions are rooted in practical applications and present field observations that are instantiated  in a microeconomic model to allow out-of-sample predictions about the mechanisms at hand. Such a  data-driven and at the same time model-based approach is ideal to develop counterintuitive insights  for competitive strategy; the insights become logical consequences of the assumptions in the model- based analysis. The tools vary from network analysis, structural dynamic estimation techniques and  dynamic programming, to game-theoretic modeling.

 A surprising side-effect of social networking is the creation of content that, when properly  organized, markedly increases social welfare. Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang and Chong (Alex) Wang, in  "Network Positions and Contributions to Online Public Goods: The Case of Chinese Wikipedia,"  examine the impact the network structure may have to encourage social content contribution. The  authors take advantage of several natural experiments in China, triggered by various Internet content   blocks between 2004 and 2008, when the government on the mainland made Wikipedia unavailable.  The blocks changed the network positions of the remaining editors, which is used to establish that a  contributor's network centrality tends to significantly influence the editor's incentives to contribute.

 A different angle on user incentives is provided by "Content Contribution for Revenue Sharing and  Reputation in Social Media: A Dynamic Structural Model," by Qian Tang, Bin Gu, and Andrew B.  Whinston. Based on an assumption that contributors to YouTube value content views, subscribers to  their respective channels, and reputation, the authors estimate a dynamic structural model for the  payoff function. At the heart of this estimation procedure is the dynamic programming problem that  underlies each agent's intertemporal decision about the intensity of the contribution effort.

 Network externalities as the key first-order consequence of the connectedness of many agents have  been thoroughly explored in the literature ever since the early 1970s. Those externalities are usually  positive, because as the number of users, say, in a communication network, increases, the utility of  participating in the network increases for each agent (e.g., by Metcalfe's law, the increase is quadratic  in the number of participants). Debabrata Dey, Atanu Lahiri, and Guoying Zhang provide an  interesting twist on this standard story in their paper "Hacker Behavior, Network Effects, and the  Security Software Market," where a higher penetration, and thus larger, network, tends to decrease a  user's ex ante benefit. This occurs because the likelihood of indirect attacks via unprotected users is  diminished, similar to the well-known vaccination problem. As a result, in a fulfilled-expectations  equilibrium, it becomes unprofitable for firms to fully cover the market.

 Finally, Ravi Mantena and Rajib L. Saha provide insights on the "Co-opetition Between  Differentiated Platforms in Two-Sided Markets." They show that co-opetition (competition and  cooperation) between platforms depends on technology asymmetries. While small asymmetries in  platform technologies can translate into large differences in their profitability, large technology  asymmetries soften the degree of competition, generally favoring the sharing of networks. The degree  of cooperation in a network economy therefore depends on the size of the competitive advantage of  the technologically dominant firm. Because of the heterogeneous consumer base, a dominant firm is  unable to capture the entire market, and the authors obtain more nuanced findings than in the usual  setting where customers are of a single type.
