 PRIOR RESEARCH ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS (IS) and electronic commerce has explored a wide spectrum  of topics including information technology (IT) investments and strategic decision-making, IT adoption and  diffusion, supply-chain management and business-to-business (B2B) electronic markets, information goods, and  the bundling of software products. The six papers that we present in this Special Section of the Journal of  Management Information Systems represent some of the newest thinking, adding significant insights to the  existing body of theoretical and managerial knowledge in the field. Collectively, the new research that we present  pushes the boundaries of what we know. The first paper employs real options thinking in a way that has never  been used before. A second sheds light on how decision-makers benchmark against one another in evaluating  the business value of an IT in order to decide when it is appropriate to adopt. The third paper shows how the  codifiability of a product that is transacted in an electronically intermediated market plays a role in determining  whether its exchange primarily occurs based on longer-term contracts or in spot markets. The papers also  provide counterintuitive results that challenge our thinking about information goods and other products that are  delivered via the Internet. A fourth paper explores how the incentives for a software vendor and the consumers  of its products can be aligned through the bundling of a base product with add-in software capabilities. A fifth  provides a new theoretical perspective on how contingent pricing can be used for information goods and  services sold via the Internet. The final paper examines how profits from information goods can be protected  through the optimal construction and enforcement of incompatible international standards in the presence of  regional piracy. We believe that JMIS readers will see the high relevance of this work for the ongoing dialog  between academic researchers, who will value the theoretical and methodological perspectives displayed, and  industry practitioners, who will be interested in the new managerial findings and fresh perspectives.

 The Special Section begins with a paper that answers the following questions: How should the evaluative  process for large-scale investments in IT be conceptualized when there is a need to trade off decision-making  speed with managerial uncertainties? What does a senior manager do when he or she wants to apply real  options thinking, but is short on historical data and not all of the assumptions of the Black-Scholes model or the  binomial model are met? Eric Clemons of the University of Pennsylvania and Bin Gu of the University of Texas,  Austin, in a paper titled &#8220;Justifying Contingent Information Technology Investments: Balancing the Need for Speed  of Action with Certainty Before Action,&#8221; deal with these questions. They develop and illustrate a new technique  that is based on the theory of real options to help senior managers to frame the right choices of strategic actions  among which they must select the most effective and value-bearing one. The authors suggest how to structure  the analysis so that the investment actions can be staged as new information becomes available to the firm. They  also emphasize the idea of chunkification, which they propose as a means to divide an IT project-related  investment into a series of stages that permit sequential implementation as real options. To bring their message to  a managerial audience, the authors examine preemptive strategies in the retail credit card business for industry  leader. They analyze the potential business value associated with the implementation of sophisticated data mining  systems that help to identify customers for which longer-term profit-maximizing product policies will be more  effective than short-term policies to extract the greatest interest income. A unique aspect of this work compared  to other real options approaches is that the authors present a technique that can be used even when the  assumptions and historical data on asset prices and volatility that typically are required are not available.

 The second paper explores a related set of issues: How does the process of information transmission among  senior managers at different firms about the expected business value of IT investments affect the extent to which  clustered or herd adoption is observed? And how does information transmission affect the propensity and timing  of firms&#8217; decisions to adopt? In &#8220;What Do You Know? Rational Expectations in Information Technology Adoption  and Investment,&#8221; Yoris Au of the University of Texas, San Antonio, and Rob Kauffman of the University of  Minnesota present a new theoretical perspective on IT adoption that incorporates the theory of rational  expectations and adaptive learning from macroeconomics. The development of shared expectations creates a  basis for senior management decision-makers to adopt in a &#8220;herd&#8221; fashion, rather than uniformly over time, as one  might expect due to the heterogeneity of the business value that each firm will attribute to an IT innovation based  on its own strategic situation. The authors present a series of propositions and an interpretative framework to  determine the breadth of potential applications of the new theory. They also discuss three mini-cases&#8212;electronic  bill payment and presentment, Wi-Fi wireless telecommunications, and XML software capabilities&#8212;that illustrate  the application of the new theories for creating new insights for senior managers.

 The next paper shifts the focus to supply-chain management-related issues. In particular, under what  conditions is forward-contracting preferred to spot-purchasing in B2B e-market-based procurement as a value- maximizing business policy for the buyer firm? And, as a result, what kinds of transactions are appropriate to be  handled in a B2B electronic market setting? In &#8220;Codifiability, Relationship-Specific Information Technology  Investment, and Optimal Contracting,&#8221; Moti Levi of Pennsylvania State University, Paul Kleindorfer of the University  of Pennsylvania, and D.J. Wu from the Georgia Institute of Technology explore how the relative codifiability of  products will affect exchange in an electronic market. Codifiability is an indicator of how well the buyer and the  supplier are able to agree upon a set of contractual specifications in a written electronic form for the goods or  services that are to be exchanged. Based on an optimizing model that involves buyer selection of procurement  contracts from many suppliers, the authors are able to show the sellers&#8217; bidding strategies, the buyer&#8217;s optimal  contract portfolio, and the conditions that result in a Nash equilibrium. The authors argue that lower transactional  codifiability makes it less attractive for the buyer to purchase from a larger number of sellers and to procure in the  spot market. In addition, they suggest that high investment levels in e-market IT transaction capabilities to support  electronic codifiability will tend to reduce the number of contract-based purchases.

 When software vendors bundle add-ins in software products, are consumers and producers better off, or is  bundling add-ins only good for the vendors? The fourth paper in the Special Section, &#8220;Consumers Prefer Bundled  Add-Ins,&#8221; by Rajiv Dewan and Marshall Freimer of the University of Rochester, explores vendor bundling  strategies for profitability and consumer welfare relative to base software with add-in products using game  theory. An add-in is a piece of software that adds to the functionality of a base product, such as an extension to   an operating system or a plug-in for an Internet browser. The authors model the inclusion of a software add-in to  the base software product in terms of customers who value the add-in and those who do not. For the latter, the  all-in price of the bundle is likely to include what the customer perceives as a penalty component. The software  vendor&#8217;s profits come from a number of different segments, including users who purchase just the base  software and users who will purchase the base and add-in software together. The authors&#8217; model reveals that  the profit-maximizing price satisfies the conditions for a Nash equilibrium, and that the price for a bundled-based  software with an add-in should be lower than the straight sum of the prices. A counterintuitive result is that the  total surplus of all consumers increases when bundling leads to a higher profit level for the producer of the base  software product. This apparent alignment of incentives between the software vendor and consumers provides  an interesting commentary, adding caution to the claim in prior research that vendors tend to prefer bigger  software bundles.

 One characteristic of many IT products and services such as online trading execution, Internet service  provision, and Web hosting is that product delivery and consumption are concurrent. To what extent is it  appropriate for IT product and service vendors to offer rebates to customers when their products perform poorly,  and how should they configure the related contingent prices? Do customers benefit from firms&#8217; offering of  rebates on goods and services that may be delivered with different levels of quality? Quality-contingent pricing is  one means that firms have at their disposal to signal to potential customers about the quality of their IT products  and services when uncertainty exists in the marketplace. Hemant Bhargava, University of California, Davis, and  Shankar Sundaresan, Penn State University, explore how to effectively strategize about the offering of quality- contingent prices and customer rebates. Their paper, &#8220;Contingency Pricing for Information Goods and Services  Under Industrywide Performance Standard,&#8221; develops a mathematical model that permits the analysis of monopoly  and duopoly competitors who sell with quality-contingent prices. Bhargava and Sundaresan demonstrate the  important role of private information about the firm&#8217;s ability to deliver a product or service at a given level of quality.  They also find that contingent pricing is the dominant strategy for the firm when the market underestimates the  quality of its goods and services. The work has implications for IT-intensive businesses that include  telecommunications services, e-commerce, and information goods, as well as IT infrastructure and systems and  transactions outsourcing services.

 How should firms make business decisions to create disincentives for piracy in the market for DVD movies  and related information goods? Is it appropriate to maintain regional standards for incompatibility? The final paper  of the Special Section is &#8220;Economic Implications of Variable Technology Standards for Movie Piracy in a Global  Context,&#8221; by Ram Chellappa and Shivendu Shivendu of the University of Southern California. At present, the  primary approach to control information goods piracy is technological; for example, DVD makers and movie  studios have created standard cryptographic codes that differ in various regions of the world, and that tie in with  the capability of DVD players to decode the encoded discs. The authors develop a profit-maximization model to  represent the producer&#8217;s disc quality, pricing, and compatibility choices. They find that in the presence of  regionally incompatible standards, it is optimal for the movie studio to sell a higher-quality fully-enhanced DVD in  one region with a higher price, and a lower-quality less-enhanced version in another region with a lower price.  However, when two regions have consumers with different levels of willingness to pay, profit-maximizing DVD  producers should build incentive compatibility into their pricing scheme so that the appropriate products are  purchased by self-selecting consumers in the different regions.
</p>
<p>
 The authors also show how to construct pricing policy in the presence of piracy for enhanced-quality DVDs  by distinguishing between the movie studios&#8217; need to pay information rents, which ensures incentive-compatible  purchasing, and moral rents, which ensures that consumers of high morality will continue to exhibit legitimate  purchasing behavior. Two managerial contributions in this research stand out. First, the authors show why it  makes sense to offer different quality standards and prices in different regions when consumer willingness to  pay and regional enforcement are different. Second, when widespread piracy is occurring, DVD producers will  not find it profitable to produce enhanced-quality DVDs for consumers in developed countries, leading to a  significant loss in welfare for both the producers and developed-country consumers.

 Whenever we complete our work on a Special Section of papers for the JMIS, there is a round of thanks to  share. This year, the main thanks go to our special issue reviewers, who started their work on the papers in early  June 2002. They helped us to finalize papers for the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences  (HICSS) and then provided additional rounds of input on the revised papers that they read after the conference.  Our process of obtaining an updated paper for review after the conference, as well as the reviewers&#8217; input,  ensures that the papers that the JMIS publishes here are well developed. Additional thanks are due to Rajiv  Dewan of the University of Rochester, who handled most of the HICSS papers&#8217; reviews. We also thank Eric  Clemons for his invitation to Bin Wang to be a coeditor of this issue, based on her past participation in the  conference and in the review processes of the past two or three years, and Vladimir Zwass for agreeing that  her capabilities had developed to the point where she would be a strong contributor to the overall quality of the  issue. Rob Kauffman thanks the HICSS Cochairs and the Editor for their continued contributions toward making the  e-commerce economics and IT strategy mini-tracks premier opportunities each year for getting feedback on  research in these areas, and the MIS Research Center at the University of Minnesota for supporting this  work.
