 THIS SPECIAL ISSUE REPRESENTS THE REVISED AND EXPANDED best papers from the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Symposium on  Competitive Strategy, Economics and Information Systems held at the 2013 Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences and the  related conference mini-track. It also represents 25 years of continuing progress and evolution in the field, and many years of a pioneering  partnership between the Journal of Management Information Systems and the field of information economics and competitive strategy. JMIS  was perhaps the first academic venue to welcome the field, predating the Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE), and  has provided a welcome home as the field changed, grew, and evolved.
</p>
<p>
 The first three papers help define the past, present, and future of the field. "Firm Strategy and the Internet in U.S. Commercial Banking,"  by Kim Huat Goh and Robert J. Kauffman, starts by examining questions raised by Clemons and Kimbrough in 1986 concerning the  strategic necessity hypothesis, and uses modern econometric analysis to substantiate what was, in 1986, merely a well-argued and logical  guess [1]. By focusing on technology, regulation, and social effects, "Health-Care Security Strategies for Data Protection and Regulatory  Compliance," by Juhee Kwon and M. Eric Johnson, links us to the future of our field. Information technology and information economics  professionals must take a greater role in the regulatory and social welfare challenges that society will face as a result of technological  progress, changed information endowment, increases in capability, and threats to privacy. "The Impact of Cloud Computing: Should the IT  Department Be Organized as a Cost Center or a Profit Center?" by Vidyanand Choudhary and Joseph Vithayathil, ties us back to our  earliest roots, when the field focused on information-based strategy for the information technology (IT) function itself.

 The next three papers address information-enabled strategy and competition. "Channel Capabilities, Product Characteristics, and the  Impacts of Mobile Channel Introduction," by Youngsok Bang, Dong-Joo Lee, Kunsoo Han, Minha Hwang, and Jae-Hyeon Ahn, studies the  influence of the introduction of the newest channel, mobile, on channel competition. "The Competitive Business Impact of Using  Telemedicine for the Treatment of Patients with Chronic Conditions," by Balaraman Rajan, Abraham Seidmann, and Earl R. Dorsey, shows  how modern online channel competitive affects competition in medicine; it brings together the newest channel with perhaps the oldest of  professions. "Competing with Piracy: A Multichannel Sequential Search Approach," by Xianjun Geng and Young-Jin Lee, examines how  legitimate channels compete with free illegitimate pirate channels and shows that the intensity of competition in the traditional channels- which, of course, affects pricing-also influences the optimal strategies of legitimate players when competing with pirates.

 The final four papers show how online behavior, including behavior of friends in social networks and the presence of online reviews, affect  competition in physical products, information-based products, and services. "Network Structure and Observational Learning: Evidence from  a Location-Based Social Network," by Zhan Shi and Andrew B. Whinston, uses empirical data to demonstrate that observing the behavior of  friends in online social networks affects consumers and potential consumers differently from observing the queuing behavior of strangers.  Interestingly, the "proximity" of the social connection has a dramatic effect on behavior. In "How Do Consumer Buzz and Traffic in Social  Media Marketing Predict the Value of the Firm?" Xueming Luo and Jie Zhang show that social buzz and traffic are closely related in a  virtuous circle, with buzz generating traffic and traffic generating buzz. "Consumer Learning and Time-Locked Trials of Software  Products," by Debabrata Dey, Atanu Lahiri, and Dengpan Liu, shows that the impact of using free trial software products on consumers'  behavior will be affected by the speed with which consumers can actually learn about the product. In other words, the impact of demos on   reducing uncertainty is a function of how quickly users learn true product attributes from the demo packages. Finally, "Reducing Buyers'  Uncertainty About Taste-Related Product Attributes," by Panos M. Markopoulos and Eric K. Clemons, shows how online information and  reduced uncertainty, which they call informedness, affect company strategy by enabling resonance marketing. This builds on a number of  papers previously published in JMIS on this subject, and extends both the mathematical analysis and the understanding of the managerial  implications of resonance marketing.

 This Special Issue showcases the research streams in the information systems literature that are being actively pursued by numerous  academic and industry researchers around the world, who are focused on creating new innovations with information economics for  corporate strategy. From the contents, the reader can see that rich and insightful new contributions of knowledge are offered for multiple  industry contexts, including financial services, mobile telephony, health-care services and telemedicine, IT services, and resonance  marketing. Also demonstrated is the extent to which economics and technology-related thinking have the potential to shape the next  generation of business process design and marketing activities in Internet-based selling, the extent of trial use by consumers of software  products prior to purchase, and the way that use of social media may be connected to the value of the firm. In addition, the emphasis that we  have placed on considering the more timeless issues of strategic advantage and strategic necessity, the organization of the IT department  in the firm, and how IT transforms the opportunity for the firm to leverage consumer informedness, reflects the evolution of the scholarship  in information economics and corporate strategy.
</p>
<p>
 If the high effects on technology-led management and strategy from the first 25 years of research in this stream published in JMIS are any  indication, then future research in this area, as we broaden its coverage to include regulation, law, and society issues, offers outstanding  possibilities for the development of relevant new knowledge, and business and industry innovations.
