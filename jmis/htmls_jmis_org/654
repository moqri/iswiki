<p><p>
 THIS SPECIAL ISSUE ADDRESSES A SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE among interested researchers: the  relationships between organizational investment in information technology (IT) and organizational performance  and productivity. Despite the enormous investment in IT during recent years, demonstrating the effects of  such investment on organizational performance has proven extremely difficult. The present Special Issue is  intended to enhance this area of research by encouraging the development of new perspectives of the IT  investment-performance relationships, thereby expanding the portfolio of methods used in investigating these  relationships.
</p>
<p>
 Some recent studies of relationships between investment in IT and organizational performance and  productivity [1, 2, 4, 10, 12, 14] have reported positive and significant effects of such investment. Some  researchers question these results on the grounds that the studies involved examination of primarily  cross-sectional data. This criticism stems at least in part from the premise that the benefits of IT investment  can be realized only over longer periods of time. However, it is possible, indeed likely, that in many instances  IT has the potential to provide important benefits within the same year the investment is made. In any event,  research reflecting relationships between IT investment and organizational performance and productivity might  be more convincing if it were based on IT investment in both current and earlier periods. Although some  authors [3, 9, 13] have speculated on the lagged effects of IT investment, there have so far been no empirical  studies, with the exception of one reported in a conference [11], that have demonstrated a relationship  between such investment and organizational performance and productivity in subsequent periods. This Special  Issue contains a paper by Sarv Devaraj and Rajiv Kohli that reports on their longitudinal research design in  identifying lag effects of IT investment.
</p>
<p>
 Another reason for disagreement among researchers involves the argument that correlations reflecting  relationships between IT investment and organizational performance and productivity do not necessarily imply  causation, particularly if the correlations are based on data from the same year only [12]. It has also been  emphasized that causality cannot be established by using conventional statistical techniques. The call for  papers for this Special Issue encouraged researchers to apply multivariate (e.g., canonical correlation  analysis) and nonparametric (e.g., data envelopment analysis) methods, as opposed to more commonly used  methods such as correlation and regression analyses, to enable them to infer causality, if present, between IT  investment and organizational performance and productivity. Accordingly, Sumit Sircar, Joe L. Turnbow, and  Bijoy Bordoloi, as well as Byungtae Lee and Nirup M. Menon in their papers in this Special Issue report on their  use of multivariate and nonparametric methods in analyzing study data.
</p>
<p>
 Some researchers have flatly rejected the conclusions of studies that found positive relationships between  investment in IT and organizational performance and productivity. One went so far as to call such conclusions  "the big lie of the information age" [15]. Perhaps a more valid method of determining whether IT is living up to  expectations is through analyses involving both cross-sectional and longitudinal databases involving hundreds  or even thousands of data points from various industries. Large databases would serve to average out  extremes and provide a clearer picture of the underlying relationship between IT investment and organizational  performance. A report on findings from a study using multiyear, cross-sectional data is provided here by  Sumit Sircar, Joe L. Turnbow, and Bijoy Bordoloi, and by Byungtae Lee and Nirup M. Menon.
</p>
<p>
 Based on the review of a number of research studies that were presented at the Workshop on Information  Systems and Economics (WISE), Brynjolfsson and Hitt [5, p. 50] state that, "[w]hile the average returns to IT  investment are solidly positive, there are huge variations across organizations, some have spent vast sums  on IT with little benefit, while others have spent similar amounts with tremendous success." They hold that the  greatest benefits of IT appear to be realized by organizations when IT investment is coupled with other  complementary investments such as organizational reengineering, restructuring, and redesign. Also, it is quite  possible that the nature of some businesses may be such that they may not be able to obtain as great a  return from IT as other organizations might. Another purpose of this Special Issue was to encourage  researchers to go beyond the sole effects of IT investment and explore these complementary issues. We are  pleased to report that Sarv Devaraj and Rajiv Kohli examine the combined effects of IT and business process  reengineering on organizational performance, while Byungtae Lee and Nirup M. Menon examine the relationship  between IT investment levels and technical and allocative efficiencies in a firm. Michael J. Davern and Robert  J. Kauffman also contribute in this area by presenting a perspective for understanding a firm's potential IT  value and for relating this to realized value.
</p>
<p>
 "Despite the fact [that] the productivity paradox of IT is an international phenomenon," according to  Dewan and Kraemer [6, p. 57], most of the existing studies in this area involve firm-level analysis mainly  conducted in the United States using American firms. With the exception of the Dewan and Kraemer research,  no international-level studies have previously been conducted. We believe it is important that researchers add  an international dimension to the matter of IT investment-performance relationships, extending beyond the  United States to encompass the experience of organizations in other developed countries. In this Special  Issue, Paul P. Tallon, Kenneth L. Kraemer, and Vijay Gurbaxani, as well as Arik Ragowsky, Dennis A. Adams,  and Myles Stern report on their respective uses of international data.
</p>
<p>
 It has been argued that traditional IT investment-performance analyses have not been very successful in  the past because of their overreliance on financial data. Some researchers (e.g., [4]) have called for additional  research to identify "hidden costs and benefits" that are typically not included in a traditional analysis of IT  investment relationships with organizational performance and productivity. In their paper in this Special Issue,   Sherry D. Ryan and David A. Harrision provide insights into what they believe to be one of the sources of  such hidden costs-namely, those associated with human resources.
</p>
<p>
 The divide between the several groups of researchers investigating the effects of IT investment,  discussed above, is rather common knowledge. One group, emphasizing the need for use of qualitative  analysis, believes that quantitative measures have received preferential consideration in the research  performed to date. The quantitative group is somewhat vocal about what it considers the superiority derived  from the rigors of its approach. Some members of this group even go so far as to say that they do not  believe in qualitative measures of IT productivity. They argue that qualitative measures can be used only if  they first concur with the quantitative measures of IT payoff. Yolande E. Chan does a fine job in bringing  forward and explaining this controversy. This Special Issue also includes a number of research studies that  use qualitative data (e.g., by Paul P. Tallon, Kenneth L. Kraemer, and Vijay Gurbaxani; by Akemi Takeoka  Chatfield and Philip W. Yetton; and by Sherry D. Ryan and David A. Harrison) to emphasize that there is  room for both camps in IT productivity research. Ideally, the work of each group should complement that of  the other.
</p>
<p>
 In summary, we believe this Special Issue makes a significant contribution to the ongoing debate over the  value of IT investment by shedding new light on organizational experiences with IT investment. We feel the  research presented here, by providing new insights, moves the area of IT investment research to a new level  of inquiry. It is clear that, while progress is being made in the area, the various approaches used in measuring  IT payoffs are not universally accepted and the conclusions are arguable. The papers presented here focus on  critical, yet insufficiently explored, dimensions of the IT payoff question. These papers, selected from a large  number of manuscripts submitted by authors within and outside the United States, collectively exemplify the  study of this critical question in both national and global environments. We now introduce to you the papers  included in this Special Issue.
</p>
<p>
 As described in the first paper, Sherry D. Ryan and David A. Harrison interviewed fifty IT  decision-makers in various industries in conducting an investigation of social subsystem costs related to IT  decisions. Ryan and Harrison's study supported the observation that IT decisions are traditionally focused on  financial or technological issues. The results further indicated that human-related costs often are not  considered, or are minimized or ignored until after IT is implemented, resulting in less than optimal investment  decisions and thereby reducing the potential benefits of IT investments. The paper extends existing theory by  describing systematic patterns of inclusion and exclusion of related costs and benefits. In addition, a decision  aid is provided to help IT executives begin to think about which social subsystem costs and benefits should be  incorporated into various decisions.
</p>
<p>
 Sarv Devaraj and Rajiv Kohli examined monthly data from eight hospitals over a three-year period to  evaluate possible relationships between IT investment measures and performance measures of profitability  and quality. Holding that the difficulty in identifying the impacts of technology in past research has been the  isolation of such benefits from other factors that may also contribute to organizational performance, they  sought to determine whether another organizational factor-namely, business process reengineering  (BPR)-had a positive impact on measures of organizational profitability and quality. Using a longitudinal  research design, the study found positive lag effects of IT investment on organizational profitability. Also, IT  investment was found to have a positive effect on organizational quality initiatives. BPR alone was not found  to lead to improvement in profitability; however, evidence was found that IT capital investment combined with  BPR had a positive impact on profitability.
</p>
<p>
 Sumit Sircar, Joe L. Turnbow, and Bijoy Bordoloi reviewed earlier studies of the impact of information  technology (IT) on firm performance, noting that previous research provided conflicting findings. Extending  this earlier work, they analyzed a large database by use of canonical correlation, finding strong empirical  validity for the premise that a relationship exists between sets of IT investment measures (as opposed to  individual measures) and firm performance. Further investigation revealed that, overall, IT investment  (computer capital, MIS staff and staff training, and other MIS), and non-IT investment (labor and noncomputer  capital) were directly related to firm performance measures.
</p>
<p>
 Byungtae Lee and Nirup M. Menon extended previous research of the contributions of IT to the  enhancement of output. Using 19 years of data from hospitals, they applied both parametric and  nonparametric approaches to evaluating the effects of IT. In addition to productivity measures, they  estimated error terms representing various inefficiencies in business processes. Efficiency, measured through  post-hoc analyses, provided information on how well the mix of inputs impacted production, as well as on how  well costs and the productivity impacts of inputs were factored into decision making during resource allocation.  In addition, the authors used efficiency results to distinguish between over- and underinvestment in IT and to  infer the relationship between level of investment and process reengineering.
</p>
<p>
 Michael J. Davern and Robert J. Kauffman present a method of measuring IT value that emphasizes the  importance of understanding where potential value lies and how best to relate it contextually to the  measurement of a firm's realized value. Using concepts such as locus of value and value conversion  contingencies, the authors developed the idea that complementary assets (particularly business process  design and human capital) have some bearing on the firm's realization of value. In contrast to earlier process  models of IT value that begin with IT expenditures, their analysis emphasizes the initial assessment of   potential value for an IT investment. They suggest that the critical level of analysis for understanding how  potential value is transformed into realized value may be different from the level of analysis at which the  business case for investment, and thus potential value, was initially established.
</p>
<p>
 Paul P. Tallon, Kenneth L. Kraemer, and Vijay Gurbaxani used another approach to assessing the impacts  of IT, applying a process-oriented model to estimate possible impacts on critical business activities within the  value chain. The model incorporates four types of corporate goals for IT and management practices as key  determinants of realized IT payoffs. To evaluate the model, and in recognition of the increasing role that  executives play in IT investment decisions, the authors based their assessment of IT payoffs on a worldwide  survey of executives' perceptions of realized IT impacts. The survey confirmed that the goals were useful  indicators of IT payoffs. It was also found that the adoption of certain management practices enables firms to  realize higher levels of IT business value.
</p>
<p>
 The research reported by Arik Ragowsky, Myles Stern, and Dennis A. Adams had two objectives. The first  was to find support for the premise that benefits derived through the use of information systems (IS) depend  on an organization's operating characteristics (e.g., number of suppliers and lead time for purchase orders).  The second was to show that the relationship between the benefits of an IS and an organization's operating  characteristics was stronger for a specific IS application than for the entire IS applications portfolio considered  as a whole. Using data from over 500 manufacturing firms in Israel and the United States, the authors found  no beneficial relationship between the overall organizational IS and the operating characteristics of  organizations for either country. However, for identical specific IS applications in both countries, a beneficial  relationship with operational characteristics was noted.
</p>
<p>
 Focusing on a more narrow aspect of information technology applications, Akemi Takeoka Chatfield and  Philip W. Yetton report on the conduct of cross-case analyses of three organizations that initiated  sophisticated electronic data interchange (EDI) networks but that experienced different levels of strategic  payoffs. Applying sociological theories of embeddedness, they postulate that the relationship between EDI  use and strategic benefits is moderated by EDI embeddedness, which they define as a measure of how  central or peripheral a specific EDI network is to managing firm interdependence.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, Yolande E. Chan observes that, to provide evidence that would be considered by an executive  audience, many past studies of the relationships between IT investment and organizational performance have  focused exclusively on quantitative performance measures. She calls for renewed recognition of the important  contributions made by "soft" IT value measures and individual-level measures and suggests that researchers  need to recognize the important contributions that can be made by qualitative measures, and by individual and  group-level analyses in IT value research.
