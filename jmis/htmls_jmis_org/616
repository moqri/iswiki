<p>ABSTRACT: The concept of information resource management (IRM) has been surrounded by confusion for almost two decades. This study first defines the IRM construct as a comprehensive approach to planning, organizing, budgeting, directing, monitoring, and controlling the people, funding, technologies, and activities associated with acquiring, storing, processing, and distributing data to meet a business need for the benefit of the entire enterprise. The study then operationalizes the IRM construct by developing a measurement instrument. The instrument demonstrates acceptable content validity as well as construct validity and reliability. Eight dimensions underlying the IRM construct were found via exploratory factor analysis chief information officer, planning, security, technology integration, advisory committees, enterprise model, information integration, and data administration. The instrument serves two functions: (1) to create a coherent, theoretical foundation for further research on the IRM construct, and (2) to provide reference norms for practicing managers to use to assess the extent of IRM implementation in their organizations.</p>
