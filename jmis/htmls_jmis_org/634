<p>ABSTRACT: Office systems have traditionally been effective in automating well-defined and structured office tasks that are performed by personnel who account for a minor share of the office payroll. To make an impact on office environments, office systems must be able to support effectively semi-structured or unstructured office tasks that are generally performed by managers and professionals. This paper provides a conceptual focus through a framework for analyzing the office functions of managers, and a technological focus and direction through a design and architecture of an Integrated Office Information System (IOIS) for implementing such a concept that supports the less structured activities of managers.</p>
