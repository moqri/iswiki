He was among the first scholars to study online global securities trading, business process outsourcing, channel conflict and e-commerce, and the effect of information on product proliferation and the transformation of consumer behavior in these new marketplaces. More recently, he has begun studying privacy and the challenges of applying current antitrust law to online business models. He is the founder and project director for the Wharton School’s Sponsored Research Project on Information: Strategy and Economics within the Program for Global Strategy and Knowledge Intensive Organizations. He has also held appointments at the Harvard Business School, the Johnson School of Management at Cornell, the Engineering College at Cornell, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Peking University Law School, and the Desautels Centre at the Rotman School of the University of Toronto. He has published over 100 scholarly papers and regularly publishes online in Huffington Post, Business Insider, and Tech Crunch.</p><p>RAJIV M.

<p>The rapid adoption of social networks in industrialized countries affects the organization of activities, the allocation of resources, and the way individuals interact with each other and with institutions. The results can be powerfully positive, such as in crowdsourcing, where a task that might be too expensive to carry out alone becomes suddenly feasible by distributing it to an online user base. They can also be more problematic, when companies use their newfound proximity to their users to extract larger rents: especially with the most unsuspecting of the online population, the young and vulnerable. The two papers in this Special Section explore the complex and contradictory effects of online connectivity by presenting advancing hypotheses and empirical observations about the good, the bad, and the ugly in online interactions. The authors also suggest paths for regulators to improve social welfare by requiring widespread access to a common information infrastructure.</p>
<p>The first paper, “Task Division for Team Success in Crowdsourcing Contests: Resource Allocation and Alignment Effects,” by Indika Dissanayake, Jie Zhang, and Bin Gu, studies how the allocation of human capital on a crowdsourcing platform affects team performance. Based on a large data set from Kaggle.com, the work highlights the importance of different capabilities, here represented by “social capital” and “intellectual capital,” for different roles in a virtual team effort. In particular, the authors observe that team performance is positively related with the team leader’s social capital and with any team expert’s intellectual capital, while an increase of the other capability for the leader or an expert has no positive effect on team performance. The authors also argue that the aggregation of capabilities across the members of a team is non-uniform, in the sense that a simple average or direct sum of the values for the individuals is not the best indicator for team performance. This is because an individual’s role in the team moderates the impact of his or her capabilities.</p>
<p>These observations are significant because the observed incentives in the data set are strong, with a median reward of about $8,000 (and an average reward of about $15,000) for more than 700 teams participating in Kaggle’s crowdsourcing competitions. Interestingly, with an increase of the competitiveness in a given task, as measured by a decrease of the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), the importance of the social-intellectual alignment for team performance diminishes. Thus, when exposed to greater competitive pressure, teams with a similar level of capabilities do better both socially and intellectually. While this might seem intuitive, it is empirically surprising that the converse holds when competitive pressures are low, that is, teams with less well-aligned capabilities do better. This study is the first to focus on the effects of team members’ heterogeneity on the team’s performance in crowdsourcing tasks.</p>
<p>The second paper, “Family Preferences Concerning Online Privacy, Data Mining, and Targeted Ads: Regulatory Implications,” by Eric K. Clemons and Joshua S. Wilson, analyzes international survey data about the online activities of teenagers as well as parental awareness and preferences about data-mining practices related to their children. The authors note that combining user-specific information from a variety of sources enables companies such as Google and organizations purchasing this type of data to estimate consumer preferences very well. They can now do this to a resolution that allows a high degree of price discrimination in order to extract greater rents overall, revealing each individual’s entire willingness to pay. The implications of data mining for privacy are worse because the adverse consequences are potentially longer-lived, especially with respect to vulnerable user groups.</p>
<p>Using survey data from the United States, Germany, Japan, and several South American countries, the authors argue that there is a wide gap between the online behavior of teens and parental awareness, and preferences about privacy. By penetrating the institutional safety of schools, once-trusted companies are able to collect private data about unsuspecting users, which can only be the tip of the iceberg for the information aggregates, collected and sold as “big data” to third parties. The authors explore the real costs associated with targeted ads and data mining, and then lay the groundwork for a structured discussion about regulatory intervention, which so far has barely begun. A case in point is the recent intervention of the European Union into Google’s potential abuse of its market power by exploiting control over data aggregates to serve its own interest [1]. This paper is one of the first systematic empirical investigations to link potential corporate malpractice in extracting consumer data and public policy. Thus, it is a pioneering piece in opening up a new line of inquiry into regulatory intervention for the protection of privacy and the limitation of corporate data use.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, both papers tackle new types of incentives that matter because of online social connections. Individuals can form virtual teams and try to perform well together by assigning roles to different members. A higher degree of connectedness therefore results, all else equal, in more teams and thus a higher degree of competitiveness (measured in the HHI of “brain share” concentration), changing the returns to diversity in teams. On the other hand, corporations are embracing their users’ online presence by tracking behavior and finding ways to mine the data so as to improve predictive accuracy, with the goal of using this one-sided intimacy to their advantage. This is a form of collusion against consumers. Here one can also expect an excess return for those who perform best at extracting information rents. This is ultimately likely to reduce variety, and is a counterintuitive outcome for the diverse beginnings of social connections.</p>
