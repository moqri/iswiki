<p>ABSTRACT: Expert systems and multimedia are being incorporated into organizations at increasing rates because, while being independently developed, they possess capabilities appropriate for integration with each other. This paper examines the potential for such integration, providing support to users beyond the capabilities of each independently used technology. An integrated system, essential to the city of Los Angeles during the 1992 riots and the 1994 earthquake, is examined to demonstrate the usefulness and benefits of expert systems and multimedia integration. The potential for this integration is further explored by examining issues related to an integration framework where the two technologies support each other. Three integrated prototype systems are reviewed to promote the legitimacy of expert systems and multimedia integration. Preliminary findings conclude that this integration will offer benefits to various applications.</p>
