However, they experience two problems attributable to anonymity abuse--easy identity changes and reputation manipulation. In this study, we propose the use of stylometric analysis to help identify online traders based on the writing style traces inherent in their posted feedback comments. We incorporated a rich stylistic feature set and developed the Writeprint technique for detection of anonymous trader identities. The technique and extended feature set were evaluated on a test bed encompassing thousands of feedback comments posted by 200 eBay traders. Experiments conducted to assess the scalability (number of traders) and robustness (against intentional obfuscation) of the proposed approach found it to significantly outperform benchmark stylometric techniques. The results indicate that the proposed method may help militate against easy identity changes and reputation manipulation in electronic markets.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,49,78

Despite the recent proliferation of techniques and the availability of more sophisticated methods for this task, the interview technique continues to be widely used, especially in business domains. This paper reports the results of an experiment conducted to compare the unstructured knowledge acquisition interview with a specific type of structured knowledge acquisition interview. Structure for the interview was provided by a domain model of the business decision-making activity that attempted to capture the subjective and qualitative aspects of decision making. Senior managers from industry served as the subjects in the experiment. The interview technique was evaluated along efficiency and effectiveness dimensions. Results indicate improved performance with the structured interviewing method.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,1,123,140

However, empirical research in this area has been beset by conflicting conceptualizations of the trust construct, inadequate attention to its underlying dimensions, causes, and effects, and lack of a validated trust scale. This paper addresses these limitations in part by theoretically conceptualizing and empirically validating a scale to measure individual trust in online firms. The proposed scale taps into three key dimensions of trust: trustee's ability, benevolence, and integrity. An iterative testing and refinement procedure using two field surveys of online retailing and online banking users, leads to a final seven-item trust scale that exhibits adequate levels of reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and nomological validity. It is expected that the scale presented in this paper will assist future empirical research on trust in online entities.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,1,211,241

Virtual integration represents the substitution of ownership with partnership by integrating a set of suppliers through information technology (IT) for tighter supply-chain collaboration. From the systems and control perspectives, this study develops a theory of virtual integration with an empirical model to examine the role that virtual integration plays in facilitating manufacturers to achieve greater manufacturing flexibility and comparative cost advantage. Based on a survey of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our results show that environmental uncertainty tends to motivate manufacturers to increase their manufacturing flexibility, with both virtual integration and supplier responsiveness playing a vital enabling role. The results demonstrate the importance of supplier responsiveness for manufacturers to gain manufacturing flexibility and comparative cost advantage in supply-chain operations. Environmental uncertainty, thus, might first appear as a threat to a manufacturer, but with the help of IT and more responsive suppliers, such a threat could be transformed into a competitive edge, as reflected in the manufacturer's higher levels of manufacturing flexibility and comparative cost advantage.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,2,41,64

We develop a research model positing that IT resources and IT capabilities enhance a firm's performance by providing support to its competitive strategies and core competencies, and the strengths of these supports vary in accord with environmental dynamism. The model is empirically tested using data collected from 296 firms in China. It is found that IT resources generate more business effects in stable environments than in dynamic environments, while IT capabilities generate more business effects in dynamic environments than in stable environments. The results suggest that the BVIT creation mechanism in stable environments is primarily resource structuring while the mechanism in dynamic environments is primarily capability building.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,2,325,367
5, Richard W. Wang;  Diane M. Strong,Beyond Accuracy: What Data Quality Means to Data Consumers, data administration;  data quality;  database systems,"Poor data quality (DQ) can have substantial social and economic impacts. Although firms are improving data quality with practical approaches and tools, their improvement efforts tend to focus narrowly on accuracy. We believe that data consumers have a much broader data quality conceptualization than IS professionals realize. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that captures the aspects of data quality that are important to data consumers. A two-stage survey and a two-phase sorting study were conducted to develop a hierarchical framework for organizing data quality dimensions. This framework captures dimensions of data quality that are important to data consumers. Intrinsic DQ denotes that data have quality in their own right. Contextual DQ highlights the requirement that data quality must be considered within the context of the task at hand. Representational DQ and accessibility DQ emphasize the importance of the role of systems. These findings are consistent with our understanding that high-quality data should be intrinsically good, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented, and accessible to the data consumer. Our framework has been used effectively in industry and government. Using this framework, IS managers were able to better understand and meet their data consumers' data quality needs. The salient feature of this research study is that quality attributes of data are collected from data consumers instead of being defined theoretically or based on researchers' experience. Although exploratory, this research provides a basis for future studies that measure data quality along the dimensions of this framework.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1996,4,5,33
6, Shouhong Wang,Toward Formalized Object-Oriented Management Information Systems Analysis, management information systems analysis;  object-oriented systems analysis;  protocol analysis,"Object-oriented approaches have received attention in management information systems development due to the advantages over the traditional approaches claimed by the proponents of the object-oriented approaches. To describe how people actually perform object-oriented analyses, this paper formalizes an object-oriented systems analysis approach. Protocol analyses of seven systems analysts, who were experienced with structured analysis, were used to formalize procedures for object-oriented analysis. The protocol analyses revealed four fundamental types of object classes in a management information system. They are: input, output, physiomorphic, and event object classes. The identification of input, output, and event classes depends upon the problem domain being analyzed. Physiomorphic classes, on the other hand, are more likely to match a schema that is perceived by the analyst based on his a priori knowledge about the problem domain classes. The protocol analyses also revealed that object classes are identified in an ad hoc manner; however, when checking the analysis, depth-first or breadth-first searching methods are often used. These, in turn, are controlled by a global backward or forward tracing strategy. Tracing the origin of data in messages was the strategy used for checking the completeness of the analysis. An experiment was conducted to compare the protocol-based object-oriented method and structured analysis. Thirty-two students who had no previous systems analysis experience were trained and then completed a problem using both techniques. The protocol-based method produced analyses that more closely matched the problem. Furthermore, it required less time to complete an analysis, and it was perceived as easier to use by the participants than the structured analysis method.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1996,4,117,141

In this study, we identify six reasons users trust (or do not trust) a technology in the early stages of its use by extending the theories of trust formation in interpersonal and organizational contexts to that of decision support technologies. We study the particular context of decision support technologies for e-commerce: online recommendation agents (RAs), which facilitate users' decision making by providing advice on what to buy based on user-specified needs and preferences. A laboratory experiment is conducted using a multimethod approach to collect data. Both quantitative data about participants' trust in RAs and written protocols that explain the reasons for their levels of trust are collected. A content analysis of the written protocols identifies both positive and negative trust attributions that are then mapped to six trust reasons. A structural equation modeling analysis is employed to test the causal strengths of the trust reasons in explaining participants' trust in RAs. The results reveal that in the early stages of trust formation, four positive reasons (i.e., knowledge-based, interactive, calculative, and dispositional) are associated with higher trust in RAs and two negative reasons (i.e., calculative and interactive) are associated with lower trust in RAs. The results also demonstrate some distinctive features of trust formation with respect to decision support technologies. We discuss the research and practical implications of the findings and describe opportunities for future research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2008,4,249,273

However, there is limited understanding of an important element of virtual workâ€”the individuals. Our review of the literature indicates that the composition of individual knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required to work virtually would benefit from further research. In this study, we theoretically and empirically develop the construct of individual virtual competence that captures the key KSAs required to perform effectively in todayâ€™s virtualized workplace, within a parsimonious nomological network. Substantiated by its explanatory power on individual perceived performance and satisfaction, individual virtual competence contributes to the literature by acknowledging a distinct workplace competency that can be incorporated in future individual-level studies of virtual phenomena.

We consider the possibility that consumers attach different importance to various types of product differentiation, and report the equilibrium in terms of the ""quality--fit"" ratio, which measures the relative strength of preference for quality compared to preference for product fit and is a function of the cost of quality and the cost of product misfit. We also consider how different market structures (whether firms are similar or differentiated on the horizontal dimension ex ante) lead to different equilibriums when firms adopt personalization. We show that personalization by one firm leads to higher profits for both firms if product quality and misfit costs are high and the firms offer similar products ex ante. On the other hand, if firms offer differentiated products, personalization is profitable only if the effectiveness of the personalization technology is high or if both product quality and misfit costs are low. We also highlight conditions under which investments in personalization and product quality can be complements or substitutes to each other. Finally, we show that a firm can respond to a competitor's personalization by either increasing (aggressive response) or decreasing (defensive response) investments in its own quality. Our results provide insights to managers on when to invest in personalization technologies and how to adjust their investments in product quality after the firm (or its competitor) adopts personalization.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,69,95

This competition is favored in the United States by regulatory bodies such as the SEC and the CFTC, which have taken steps such as encouraging the listing of equity options on multiple exchanges and approving the applications of screen-based systems for designation as contract markets. This paper examines the design of one screen-based futures market, the Cantor Financial Futures Exchange (CX), and describes its capabilities relative to the rival, floor-based market in Chicago. In comparison to traditional open-outcry mechanisms, the CX order-matching system maintains strict first in--first out time priority among submitted orders.

To manage this ever-increasing volume of documents, individuals and organizations frequently organize their documents into categories that facilitate document management and subsequent access and browsing. Document clustering is an intentional act that should reflect individual preferences with regard to the semantic coherency and relevant categorization of documents. Hence, effective document clustering must consider individual preferences and needs to support personalization in document categorization. In this paper, we present an automatic document-clustering approach that incorporates an individual's partial clustering as preferential information. Combining two document representation methods, feature refinement and feature weighting, with two clustering methods, precluster-based hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) and atomic-based HAC, we establish four personalized document-clustering techniques. Using a traditional content-based document-clustering technique as a performance benchmark, we find that the proposed personalized document-clustering techniques improve clustering effectiveness, as measured by cluster precision and cluster recall.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,2,173,201

The coherence and distinction of an existing document category can diminish considerably as influxes of new documents arrive over time. The complexity of and effort requirements for document-category management favor an automated approach that can be supported by appropriate document-clustering techniques. A review of the extant literature shows a predominant focus on document content analysis in automated document-category management, which cannot preserve the user's document-grouping preferences. This research develops two advanced evolution-based techniques for preserving user preferences in their management of document categories. The first technique (CE2), which supports the automated evolution of a set of flat (i.e., nonhierarchical) document categories, extends a promising evolution-based technique (category evolution, CE) by addressing its fundamental limitations inherent to the use of holistic measures. The second technique, category hierarchy evolution (CHE), is developed on the basis of CE2 to support scenarios where document categories are organized with a hierarchical structure. Empirical evaluations of the effectiveness of each technique in various category evolution scenarios created using two different document corpora (i.e., news documents from Reuters and research articles from the ACM digital library), as compared with those of associated salient techniques for benchmark purposes, show that CE2 and CHE outperform their respective benchmark techniques. Their performance is reasonably robust and appears more effective when the quality (coherence) of the previously created categories does not deteriorate excessively. According to our results, the evolution-based approach is viable, appealing, and capable of preserving user preferences in automatic reorganizations of document categories.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2009,4,109,143

A conceptual framework is proposed to define four components of ISDP complexity: structural organizational complexity, structural IT complexity, dynamic organizational complexity, and dynamic IT complexity. Measures of ISDP complexity are generated based on literature review, field interviews, and focus group discussions. The measures are then refined through a systematic process and are tested using confirmatory data analyses with survey responses from 541 ISDP managers. Results support the final measurement model that consists of a second-order factor of ISDP complexity, four distinct first-order factors, and 15 measurement items. The measurement adequately satisfies the criteria for unidimensionality, convergent validity, discriminant validity, reliability, factorial invariance across different types of ISDPs, and nomo logical validity.

Current search engines are very fast in terms of their response time to a user query. But their usefulness to the user in terms of retrieval performance leaves a lot to be desired. Typically, the user has to sift through a lot of nonrelevant documents to get only a few relevant ones for the user's information needs. Ranking functions play a very important role in the search engine retrieval performance. In this paper, we describe a methodology using genetic programming to discover new ranking functions for the Web-based information-seeking task. We exploit the content as well as structural information in the Web documents in the discovery process. The discovery process is carried out for both the ad hoc task and the routing task in retrieval. For either of the retrieval tasks, the retrieval performance of these newly discovered ranking functions has been found to be superior to the performance obtained by well-known ranking strategies in the information retrieval literature.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2005,4,37,56

The development of contingency theory in MIS is compared to the development of organization theory. The assumptions of fit, performance as a dependent variable, rational actors, and a deterministic model in both organizational research and MIS research are critiqued. The dominant influence of contingency theory is demonstrated through a review of empirical studies published in JMIS and MIS Quarterly. Of the 177 articles during the period studied, 59 percent were empirical and over 70 percent of these were judged to follow a contingency model. Based on our assessment of this research, we conclude that research in MIS has been hampered by the use of a naive meta-theory, conflicting empirical results with low explained variance, ill-defined concepts of performance and fit, and a narrow perspective of researchers. We give some recommendations for improving the theoretical basis of MIS, including advocating more subjectivist, less functional, and less deterministic research approaches. We also suggest a wider selection of methodologies including qualitative case studies, longitudinal studies, and ethnographic approaches. Finally, we conclude that significantly more theory-building is required in defining the MIS construct.",Journal of Management Information Systems,6,1989,1,59,85

RAs provide online shopping advice based on user-specified needs and preferences. The characteristics of RAs that may hamper consumers' trust building in the RAs are identified, and the provision of explanation facilities is proposed as a knowledge-based approach to enhance consumers' trusting beliefs by dealing with these obstacles. This study examines the effects of three types of explanations about an RA and its use--how, why, and trade-off explanations--on consumers' trusting beliefs in an RA's competence, benevolence, and integrity. An RA was built as the experimental platform and a laboratory experiment was conducted. The results confirm the important role of explanation facilities in enhancing consumers' initial trusting beliefs and indicate that consumers' use of different types of explanations enhances different trusting beliefs: the use of how explanations increases their competence and benevolence beliefs, the use of why explanations increases their benevolence beliefs, and the use of trade-off explanations increases their integrity beliefs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2007,4,217,246

Yet these teams often use approaches for project data management that may not capture project processes, contexts, rationales, or artifacts in a way that enables new project members to familiarize themselves quickly with the project history. Project information is rarely captured, retained, or indexed so that people external to the project can retrieve and apply it to future tasks. To address the issue of capturing a comprehensive project history that can subsequently be retrieved and applied to current problems, a generalizable object-oriented data model is developed. It decomposes project information into five discrete classes: projects, users, events, meetings, and documents. Through inheritance and domain references, the model describes the people, temporal events (such as meetings or single agenda items within a meeting), and archival documents that are created within a project or support some aspect of the project. These project items can be retrieved based on either contextual information (such as the dates they were created or last revised, who created them, or the projects they pertain to) or user-supplied descriptive keywords. Hypertext-like links can also be created to associate related items. Based on this model, a prototype system, Project Memory, has been developed to validate the model structure and system requirements.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1998,4,149,166

Agile IS, defined as information systems developed using agile methods, are characterized by frequent upgrades with a small number of new features released periodically. The existing research on agile IS has mainly focused on the developers' perspective with little research into end users' responses to these agile IS. Drawing upon the tripartite model of attitude, the status quo and the omission bias theories, and the availability heuristic, we propose a model that utilizes constructs from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the IS continuance model, habit, and individual differences to examine the drivers of user acceptance of agile IS. Further, we investigate not only users' intentions to continue using the agile IS but also their intentions to use new features when they are released, which is a surrogate for the ultimate success of agile IS. Data from 477 users of an agile IS showed that users' level of comfort with constant changes, the facilitating conditions provided, and users' habit are predictors of both types of intentions, with users' level of comfort with constant changes being the strongest predictor. Users' intentions to continue using agile IS are also determined by users' satisfaction with and perceived usefulness of the past upgrades. Finally, users who are innovative are more likely to use future releases of new features. The present work fills a gap in the software engineering literature and contributes a technology acceptance model specific to agile IS, which are becoming a mainstay of companies' IT portfolio in a fast-changing business environment.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,235,272

However, the suitability of the prevalent information formats in supporting various online shopping tasks is not known. Using the cognitive fit theory as the theoretical framework, we developed a research model to investigate the fit between information format and shopping task, and examine its influence on consumers' online shopping performance and perceptions of shopping experience. The competition for attention theory from the marketing literature and the scanpath theory from vision research were employed to support the analyses. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of two types of information formats (list versus matrix) in the context of two types of shopping tasks (searching versus browsing). The results show that when there is a match between the information format and the shopping task, consumers can search the information space more efficiently and have better recall of product information. Specifically, the list format better supports browsing tasks, and the matrix format facilitates searching tasks. However, a match between the information format and the shopping task has no effect on cognitive effort or attitude toward using the Web site. Overall, this research supports the application of the cognitive fit theory to the study of Web interface design. It also demonstrates the value in integrating findings from cognitive science and vision research to understand the processes involved. As the information format has been shown to affect consumers' online shopping behavior, even when the information content is held constant, the practical implications for Web site designers include providing both types of information format on their Web sites and matching the appropriate information format to the individual consumer's task.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,149,184

Whereas the traditional focus of digital library research has been on the technological development, there is now a call for user-focused research. Although millions of dollars have been spent on building ""usable"" systems, research on digital libraries has shown that potential users may not use the systems in spite of their availability. There is a need for research to identify the factors that determine users' adoption of digital libraries. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a theoretical framework, this study investigates the effect of a set of individual differences (computer self-efficacy and knowledge of search domain) and system characteristics (relevance, terminology, and screen design) on intention to use digital libraries. Based on a sample of 585 users of a university's award-winning digital library, the results strongly support the utilization of TAM in predicting users' intention to adopt digital libraries, and demonstrate the effects of critical external variables on behavior intention through perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. All of the individual differences and system characteristics have significant effects on perceived ease of use of digital libraries. In addition, relevance has the strongest effect on perceived usefulness of digital libraries.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,97,124

West,Researching the Costs of Information Systems, economies of scale;  information economics;  information services;  transaction costs,"This paper explores the issue of scale economies in the construction of information systems. Economic theory is used to identify transaction attributes that contribute to scale economies and the concept of an information system is then decomposed into separable components. Each component is analyzed with respect to the availability of one or more of the sources of scale economy. The analysis finds that each component possesses at least some potential for realizing scale economies and that some components may realize very large per-unit cost savings as scale of system use or capability is expanded. The implications of these findings for the organization of information services, including outsourcing, are highlighted and illustrated with consistent examples from IS-intensive industries. Future research is proposed with respect to the actual nature of IS scale economies; the presence of scope economies with respect to multicomponent systems; the relative importance of production costs, transaction costs, and benefits as determinants of acquisition choice; and the impact of IS acquisition method on the organization of firms and industries.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,2,75,107

We use organizational learning and capabilities to develop a conceptual model. We test the conceptual model with archival data on a broad cross section of U. S. firms. Our empirical findings indicate that firms with experience in onshore information technology (IT) outsourcing and capabilities related to IT coordination applications and process codification are more likely to engage in BPO, and firms with experience in internationalization are more likely to engage in offshore BPO. We also find that IT coordination applications have a greater impact on onshore BPO than on offshore BPO, and the effect of process codification is partly mediated through IT outsourcing.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,11,42

This paper explores the potential industry structure effects of vertical information systems (IS) standards through a case study of the U.S. home mortgage industry. We review theoretical arguments about the potential industry structure effects of standards for interorganizational coordination, and we compare the characteristics of XML-based vertical IS standards with those of electronic data interchange (EDI) to gauge the applicability of prior literature. We argue that the lower costs and wider accessibility of XML-based standards that use the Internet can result in significant changes to the structure of the mortgage industry. However, the nature of industry change will depend on the specific ways In which standards are implemented by organizations in the industry--there are many patterns of implementation with potentially different effects at the industry level of analysis. We illustrate these theoretical arguments with data from our case.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,165,191

This includes the definition of the roles of participants, a work schedule, and a definition of deliverables and deadlines. The mostly evolutionary nature of OMIS development requires that the results of these steps be monitored and adjusted when needed. Furthermore, a contingency framework and eight rules have been hypothesized, partially based on ex-post analysis of three cases (Veronica Broadcasting, Andersen Consulting, and Nationale-Nederlanden General Insurances). The paper provides concepts and a framework that may be an aid to research on refining the rules for analysis and design of OMIS.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,1,121,146

Two new browsing methods were developed and applied to the business intelligence domain: Web community uses a genetic algorithm to organize Web sites into a tree format; knowledge map uses a multidimensional scaling algorithm to place Web sites as points on a screen. Experimental results show that knowledge map out-performed Kartoo, a commercial search engine with graphical display, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Web community was found to be more effective, efficient, and usable than result list. Our visual framework thus helps to alleviate information overload on the Web and offers practical implications for search engine developers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2005,4,57,84

Building on the findings from a multicase qualitative study of organizations that had adopted the same SaaS application, we draw on three theoretical lenses (agency theory, transaction cost economics, and knowledge-based view) to develop a theoretically grounded model with three organization-level factors, three application-level factors, and application-level IT governance. Hypotheses derived from the model, as well as a set of differential hypotheses about factor influences due to on-premise versus SaaS delivery, are tested with survey responses from 207 firms in which application-level governance is operationalized with two dimensions: decision control rights (decision authority) and decision management rights (task responsibility). Three antecedents (origin of the application initiative, scope of application use, business knowledge of the IT unit) were significantly associated with application governance postimplementation, and the on-premise/SaaS subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence for the mode of application delivery as a moderator of these relationships. Overall, this study contributes to a growing body of research that takes a more modular approach to studying IT governance and provides theoretical explanations for differing application-level governance designs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,3,13,48

The negotiation setting consisted of a supervisor and a subordinate negotiating a performance budget for the subordinate. Results revealed that when supervisor performance expectations were incongruent with subordinate capability, face-to-face negotiations hit impasse at a significantly higher rate than NSS negotiations. These results held regardless of the amount of concession needed to reach consensus, and they support the contention that single-issue distributive negotiations, such as budget negotiations, can benefit from the use of an NSS. In a secondary analysis of subordinate performance after the budget negotiation, we found that NSS subordinates perceived more task conflict, which positively influenced postnegotiation performance, whereas face-to-face subordinates perceived less relational conflict, which worked through satisfaction to positively influence postnegotiation performance. This result adds to the literature by clarifying the roles that communication mode plays in a negotiation and a negotiation's aftermath.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,351,381

Our results provide a contingency perspective of information integration, which highlights that the performance outcomes of information integration are contingent on both external environmental conditions and internal operational characteristics. We find that information integration improves firms' ability to perform, particularly when they operate under favorable environmental conditions-a highly munificent and a less uncertain environment-and when they offer durable and complex products. Our findings advance contingency research on the performance outcomes of information integration for SCM.

This study examines stock market data to assess investors' responses to various transactional risks associated with IT outsourcing. More specifically, we develop and test several hypotheses to understand how transactional risks that arise due to a range of factors (i.e., the size of outsourcing contracts, difficulties in performance monitoring, asset specificity of IT resources, vendor capability, and the lack of cultural similarity between client and vendor firms) influence investors' reactions to IT outsourcing announcements. Our results indicate that most of these factors indeed significantly influence investors' perceptions of the risks involved in IT outsourcing. We discuss these findings in a larger organizational context and offer implications for both research and practice. In particular, our study offers a theoretical rationale for why negative reactions to IT outsourcing announcements may occur, while providing practitioners with several means by which they can increase the informational value of outsourcing arrangements.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2006,4,271,303

We construct a knowledge network based on coauthorship patterns extracted from four major journals in the IS field in order to analyze the distinctive characteristics of each subfield and to assess the amount of internal and external knowledge exchange that has taken place among IS researchers. This study also tests the role of different types of social capital that influence the academic impact of researchers. Our results indicate that the proportion of coauthored IS articles in the four journals has doubled over the past 25 years, from merely 40 percent in 1978 to over 80 percent in 2002. However, a significant variation exists in terms of the shape, density, and centralization of knowledge exchange networks across the four subfields of ISâ€”namely, behavioral science, organizational science, computer science, and economic science. For example, the behavioral science subgroup, in terms of internal cohesion among researchers, tends to develop the most dense collaborative relationships, whereas the computer science subgroup is the most fragmented. Moreover, external collaboration across these subfields appears to be limited and severely unbalanced. Across the four subfields, on average, less than 20 percent of the research collaboration ties involved researchers from different subdisciplines. Finally, the regression analysis reveals that knowledge capital derived from a network rich in structural holes has a positive influence on an individual researcher's academic performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,265,292

The existing literature focuses on the substitutional effect of e-markets on the traditional supply chain, yet in many situations, e-markets are used by buyers as a benchmarking tool in negotiations with traditional suppliers. This paper examines the role of e-markets in price negotiations and relationship-specific investments. We find that e-markets can be an effective tool to stimulate the traditional supplier's relationship- specific investments, lower the procurement prices, and improve the buyer's profitability and the supply-chain efficiency. Therefore, e-markets can complement rather than substitute for the traditional relationship-based supply chain. When there is quality uncertainty in the e-market offering, two effects of quality uncertainty on e-market adoption are identified. Better quality on average will increase e-market adoption, but surprisingly, increasing quality dispersion of e-markets will also help. Therefore, e-markets should strive to enlist suppliers with better quality products, but do not need to worry too much about the quality dispersion. Having better price transparency will also help in attracting more business from buyers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,9,64

Analyzing a set of eBay auction listings for identical products, we find evidence that the use of visibility-enhancing and quality-signaling discretionary auction attributes affects auction outcomes throughout the auction process (i.e., listing views, bids, and price premiums). We also find strong evidence that the number of reputable sellers in an auction marketplace moderates the effects of these discretionary attributes on auction outcomes. Specifically, as auction environments become more competitive, these attributes become more effective tools for differentiation, whereas seller feedback scores become less effective. Furthermore, sellers appear to select their strategies for employing these discretionary attributes based on both their prior experience and the number of experienced reputable sellers in the market. These findings suggest that in addition to relying on feedback scores, online sellers must take a more strategic approach in the selection of discretionary attributes in their auction listings.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,3,235,268

However, fraud and misrepresentation have led to widespread skepticism and distrust of electronic communities. We develop an evolutionary model to explore the issue of trust within an electronic community from a dynamic process perspective. This model emphasizes large populations, continuous change in community memberships, and imperfect information and memory. As the term trust is often used in the context of individual interaction, at a group level we propose using the term health to measure the sustained competitive advantages of honest members over cheaters throughout the evolution of a community. We find conditions under which an electronic community is healthy and attracts outside population. We find that many factors, such as information dissemination speed, honest players' payoffs and possible losses, new community members' initial trust status, and the replacement rate of community members, all affect the health of an electronic community, and that some of them also affect a community's size. We then discuss the implications of our research for e-community practices.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,83,110

According to TAM, IT adoption is influenced by two perceptions: usefulness and ease of use. In this study, we extend TAM to the mobile commerce context. We categorize the tasks performed on wireless handheld devices into three categories: (1) general tasks that do not involve transactions and gaming, (2) gaming tasks, and (3) transactional tasks. We propose a unified conceptual model for wireless technology adoption. In this model, task type moderates the effects of four possible determinants: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived playfulness, and perceived security. We postulate that, under the mobile context, user intention to perform general tasks that do not involve transactions and gaming is influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, user intention to play games is affected by perceived playfulness, and user intention to transact is influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived security. A survey was conducted to collect data about user perception of 12 tasks that could be performed on wireless handheld devices and user intention to use wireless technology.

While LBS confer greater connectivity and personalization on consumers, they also threaten users' information privacy through granular tracking of their preferences, behaviors, and identity. To address privacy concerns in the LBS context, this study extends the privacy calculus model to explore the role of information delivery mechanisms (pull and push) in the efficacy of three privacy intervention approaches (compensation, industry self-regulation, and government regulation) in influencing individual privacy decision making. The research model was tested using data gathered from 528 respondents through a quasi-experimental survey method. Structural equations modeling using partial least squares validated the instrument and the proposed model. Results suggest that the effects of the three privacy intervention approaches on an individual's privacy calculus vary based on the type of information delivery mechanism (pull and push). Results suggest that providing financial compensation for push-based LBS is more important than it is for pull-based LBS. Moreover, this study shows that privacy advocates and government legislators should not treat all types of LBS as undifferentiated but could instead specifically target certain types of services.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,135,173

We find that in equilibrium firms set their prices probabilistically rather than deterministically, and different firms follow different price distributions. The equilibrium pricing pattern exhibits an interesting local-competition feature in which direct price competition occurs only between firms adjacent to each other. Further, we incorporate consumers' search strategies into the model so that both search order and stopping rules are determined rationally by consumers. We show that similar patterns may continue to hold in the fully rational framework when consumers have higher inspection costs for inferior positions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,111,142

It theoretically develops and tests how the fit between knowledge (generalized and contextualized) and software tailoring task complexity influences process tailoring performance. Process tailoring performance is conceptualized in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The results from an experiment and a protocol analysis show that contextualized knowledge outperforms generalized knowledge in improving tailoring performance, and that such improvement in performance is greater in complex process tailoring tasks when compared to simple tasks.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,277,314

However, it is not easy to facilitate, particularly through information technology, and its motivations are not well understood. Recognizing two broad categories of information-that is, task and social information-this study investigates and compares the antecedents of task and social information seeking. Deriving from the relational communication perspective, informational and relational motivations are modeled as the two main antecedents of source preference and sourcing frequency in dyadic information seeking. Through a survey of employee dyads, our findings indicate that perceived information relevance is a significant antecedent of source preference for both task and social information seeking, whereas perceived relational benefit is significant in the context of task information. The results also show that perceived relational benefit has a stronger effect on source preference in task information seeking than in social information seeking. Furthermore, preference for a source is a significant antecedent of the frequency of sourcing in both contexts. This study provides an explanation of the formation of organizational communication networks. It suggests that organizational information and communication technologies not only need to support information delivery but must also facilitate relationship management for the seeker.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,211,240

Drawn upon modular systems theory, this study proposes that system modularity mitigates the risk of adopting digital supply chain systems and therefore motivates firms to digitize more of their supply chain operations. The study theorizes how the risk-mitigating effect of system modularity can be enhanced by the allocation of decision rights to the IT (information technology) unit. The main logic is that IT managers with more domain IT knowledge can better utilize their knowledge in decision making to achieve effective system modularity. We tested these theoretical propositions using a survey study of Chinese companies and found empirical support. We also found that the allocation of decision rights to the IT unit does not directly mitigate the perceived risk of digital supply chain systems, which highlights the role of decision allocation to the IT unit as a key moderator in risk mitigation. The study generates theoretical and practical implications on how IT governance and system modularity may jointly mitigate risk and foster supply chain digitization.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,325,352

To evaluate the alternate strategies, a negotiation agent system was implemented and an experiment was conducted in which 110 agent-human dyads negotiated over a four-issue online purchase task. Our results indicate that the proposed agent strategies can enhance the economic performance of the negotiated outcome (counterpart agreement ratio, individual utility, joint utility, and the distance to Pareto-efficient frontier) and maintain the human counterparts' positive perceptions toward the outcome and the agent.

Our investigation is grounded in the theory of signaling from information economics. Using methods from experimental economics, we create a laboratory online market where sellers face a moral hazard. We manipulate the level of market competition and the nature of the social network behind the feedback system and study the affect on trust, trustworthiness, and market efficiency. We find that competition in strangers networks, where market encounters are one-shot and reputation information is communicated through outside parties, improves trust, trustworthiness, and market efficiency. The efficiency advantage that partners networks, where a buyer can maintain a repeated relationship with a seller, have over strangers networks largely vanishes with the introduction of competition. This is because the difference in the pattern of social networking largely disappears. Overall, encouraging competition leads to more effective feedback systems in Internet markets. We discuss implications for trader strategy and Internet market design.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,2,145,169

We study why firms choose either or both of these sourcing channels. Using a framework of decision making under uncertainty, we explain firms' choice of B2B channels as a hedging strategy and as a method of obtaining greater managerial flexibility for the future. We show that greater uncertainty can lead to higher investment with firms more likely to invest in both public and private channels. We find that the level of information technology (IT) capability and spending is an important factor in firms' decision making. When a firm chooses its level of IT investment simultaneously with the decision about which sourcing channels to use, the firm choosing both channels selects the highest level of IT capability and the firm implementing only one channel selects lower levels of IT capability.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,145,170

Yue;  Metin Çakanyildirim,Intrusion Prevention in Information Systems: Reactive and Proactive Responses, information security;  intrusion detection;  intrusion prevention;  intrusion response,"Intrusion prevention requires effective identification of and response to malicious events. In this paper, we model two important managerial decisions involved in the intrusion prevention process: the configuration of the detection component, and the response by the reaction component. The configuration decision affects the number of alarms the firm has to investigate. It is well known that the traditional intrusion detection system generates too many false alarms. The response decision determines whether alarms are going to be investigated or rejected outright. By jointly optimizing these two decision variables, a firm may apply different strategies in protecting its informational assets: slow but accurate, rapid but inaccurate, or a mixture of the two strategies. We use the optimal control approach to study the problem. Unlike previous literature, which studied the problem with a static model, in our model, the decision on balancing the desire to detect all malicious events with the opportunity costs required to do so is time dependent. Furthermore, we show how the choice of an optimal mixture of reactive and proactive responses depends on the values of cost parameters and investigation rate parameters. We find that in our model, a high damage cost does not immediately translate to a preference of proactive response, or a high false rejection cost does not translate to a preference of proactive response. The dynamics of the problem, such as how fast alarms accumulate and how fast they can be cleared, also affect the decisions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,1,329,353

Hidden cultural dimensions could facilitate or inhibit the usability and communication effectiveness of Web sites. However, few studies have investigated the existence of cultural dimensions in Web sites. This study identifies cultural signifiers of Web documents as they relate to the masculinity-femininity dimension. We adopt an interpretive approach for investigating, identifying, and categorizing masculinity-femininity signifiers. Comparing and contrasting Web sites aimed predominantly at either men or women, we use grounded theory for constant comparison and categorization of data. The interpretive analysis is carried out within a framework of hermeneutics. Drawing from the literature of signs (semiology), we identify the signifiers and myths for the masculinity and femininity of Web documents, and report on the possible presence of masculine and feminine androgyny. Following the dictum of grounded theory, we present support for our results from theories and findings in diverse fields of study. We then report on the contributions of our research in three ways. First, the knowledge of cultural signifiers raises managers' and researchers' awareness of cultural contents of Web documents, and may lead to improvement in the clarity and communication effectiveness of Web documents..Second, our work brings forth contrasts and contradictions inherent in masculine and feminine modes of Web document development, raising questions about cultural messages within Web documents that could distort communication and promote cultural values not shared by members of the targeted community. Third, we introduce the concept of androgyny as playing a possible role in reducing such distortions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,1,87,128

We argue that such messages could have strong cultural content, which should be understood in developing Web sites. Hence, this paper explores the cultural content of Web site images and develops a theory for Web-image signifiers. This is done in two phases. Phase I has an interpretive qualitative approach that uses Grounded Theory to identify signifiers and to develop the Web-image signifiers (WIS) theory. Phase II quantitatively tests the WIS theory. Together, these two phases identify and validate signifiers of cultural dimensions in Web site images. More interestingly, the results uncover that cultural dimensions are signified in five categories, of which two, humans and buildings categories, are the most prominent. The contribution of this paper is in developing a comprehensive theory for the cultural content of Web images, identifying 48 signifiers in Web images, discovering new categories of signifiers, and providing insights into the nature of cultural signification by testing the theory. Such knowledge could heighten our sensitivity and awareness of hidden cultural messages in Web site images. The WIS theory could provide a novel approach to the cultural studies of Web images and other artifacts with cultural content. The results of this work have immediate application in the design of Web sites for a multicultural audience.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,147,200

There have been a number of studies underscoring the importance of trust in the online environment. However, most trust studies have concentrated on the initial trust, and there is little known about how trust beliefs evolve over time. The dynamics of trust are of particular importance in the use of infomediaries (online information providers), among which health infomediaries are the most important for Web consumers in dealing with their wellness and health issues. We investigate the evolution of trust using the case of health infomediaries. The examination of the temporal changes in trust was carried out through two approaches--comparative statics and dynamic analyses. The research method was laboratory experiment and the data were collected for two episodes of encounters. Two comparative statics models and one dynamic model were estimated in order to examine the parameter changes from one episode of encounter to the next as well as the dynamics of belief changes. The results of analysis show that the structure of trust changes over time and information quality becomes the single most important antecedent in infomediary trust building in the later stages of use. Furthermore, our study also indicates that satisfaction plays an important role in changing Web customers' trust beliefs. Contributions as well as research and managerial implications are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2008,4,225,248

Collaboration in Wikipedia is organized around articles, and any two editors co-editing an article have a collaborative relationship. Based on the economic theories about network games and social role theory, we propose that an editor's position in the collaboration network influences the editor's decisions about her total contribution as well as the allocation of her efforts. By leveraging panel data collected from the Chinese language version of Wikipedia and a natural experiment resulting from blocking it in mainland China, we find strong support for the proposed effect of network position on contribution behavior. Our analysis further reveals that different aspects of an individual's network position have distinct implications. This research enhances our understanding about how collaboration network structure shapes individual behavior in online mass collaboration platforms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,2,11,40

Of particular significance are the torts of strict products liability and negligence that can arise as a result of harm or injury resulting from, among other things, poor testing of systems, inadequate warnings, or failure to use state-of-the-art technology. The threat of injury has caused federal and state agencies and legislatures to consider seriously courses of action to inhibit the more injurious effects of such systems. This paper examines these two torts in some detail and illustrates how CBS developers could be threatened as a result of defective systems. We also present a framework for injury assessment and reduction of legal liability that can be used to guide CBS developers in assessing the possibility of injury resulting from development flaws. Further, the framework aids developers in their decision-making process by identifying appropriate measures to take to reduce their legal liability arising from what could be determined to be faulty systems development efforts. In addition, the use of the measures suggested by our framework might provide safer systems to avoid harming individuals.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1996,4,161,185

In many industries, firms develop e-business standards collaboratively in a standard consortium. They can choose to become a leading developer, a passive adopter, or a nonadopter. To capture firms' strategic choices at the development stage and the adoption stage, which are related due to the double-sided interactions between the two stages, we propose an integrated model of consortium-based e-business standardization. We find that firms' payoffs from standard adoption increase with the intrinsic value of the standard, but developers' benefits increase faster than passive adopters' benefits. The model examines the value of passive adopters to the standard development via network externalities, even though passive adopters do not contribute directly in the consortium. We find that passive adopters do not always exist. There are two possible equilibria for the endogenous formation of the developer network and the adopter network, one without passive adopters and one with passive adopters. How external conditions affect the endogenous formation of the consortium depends upon whether there are passive adopters in the equilibrium. Based on our analysis, we recommend strategies to e-business standard consortia to motivate firms' participation and enhance social welfare created by the standard.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2007,4,247,271

In many industries, they are collaboratively developed by firms in an open and neutral industry consortium. It is imperative to understand what drives firms' resource investments in such consortia, as they are critical for the success of e-business standardization. Based on collective action theory, we propose a research model to investigate the drivers of standard development within consortia. We test the model through a data set of 232 firms from 7 consortia. Consistent with collective action theory, our results demonstrate that firms' interests, resource availability, and consortium management effectiveness jointly determine their resource expenditures within the consortium. However, our exploratory investigation indicates differences between vendors and users, as vendors are more motivated by perceived standard benefits whereas users are more motivated by perceived process benefits. Our research provides a deeper understanding of firms' behaviors within consortia and factors driving their standard making.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,305,334

Consumer data are among the most valuable assets that firms own. An interesting phenomenon is that competing firms often trade their consumer data with each other. Based on a common-value all-pay auction framework, this paper studies the advertising competition between two firms that target the same consumer but are asymmetrically informed about the consumer value. We characterize firms' equilibrium competition strategies. The results show that better consumer information does not help the better-informed firm save the advertising expenditure but does enable it to reap a higher expected profit in competition. Sharing individual-level consumer data may soften the competition even though firms compete head-to-head for the same consumer. We also find that the better-informed firm may sell its data to its competitor but never voluntarily shares it with its competitor.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,189,222

Cyberinsurance has been proposed as a promising solution to help firms optimize security spending. However, cyberinsurance is ineffective in addressing the investment inefficiency caused by risk interdependency. In this paper, we examine two alternative risk management approaches: risk pooling arrangements (RPAs) and managed security services (MSSs). We show that firms can use an RPA as a complement to cyberinsurance to address the overinvestment issue caused by negative externalities of security investments; however, the adoption of an RPA is not incentive-compatible for firms when the security investments generate positive externalities. We then show that the MSS provider serving multiple firms can internalize the externalities of security investments and mitigate the security investment inefficiency. As a result of risk interdependency, collective outsourcing arises as an equilibrium only when the total number of firms is small.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,123,152

Previous academic studies have argued that this limitation could be partly alleviated by providing consumers with virtual product experience (VPE) to enable potential customers to experience products virtually. This paper discusses virtual control, a specific type of VPE implementation, and identifies its two dimensions: visual control and functional control. Visual control enables consumers to manipulate Web product images, to view products from various angles and distances; functional control enables consumers to explore and experience different features and functions of products. The individual and joint effects of visual and functional control were investigated in a laboratory experiment, the results of which indicated that visual and functional control increased the perceived diagnostic (i.e., the extent to which a consumer believes the shopping experience is helpful to evaluate a product) of their corresponding attribute factors, and that both visual and functional control increased consumer overall perceived diagnosticity and flow.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,111,147

The success of SVW services depends heavily on customers' continuance usage, a topic not yet adequately investigated in information systems research. It is unclear to what extent, and how, the existing theories can be extended to explain the continuance usage of such services. In consideration of the distinctive features of these services, this study adapts the dedication-constraint framework of commitment and develops a model of SVW continuance, which is assessed empirically using data collected from 438 experienced users of Second Life, a typical SVW service. Results indicate that SVW customers' continuance intention is jointly determined by two mechanisms: affective commitment (being attracted to) and calculative commitment (being locked in), with the former playing a more central role. Perceived utilitarian value, hedonic value, and relational capital promote affective commitment directly and indirectly through satisfaction, while service-specific investments in personalization and relational capital increase calculative commitment. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are subsequently discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,273,306

Grounded in the IT business-value literature and enhanced by the resource-based theory of the firm, we developed a research framework in which both the main effects and the interaction effects of e-commerce and IT on firm performance were tested. Within this theoretical framework, we formulated several hypotheses. We then developed a multidimensional e-commerce capability construct, and after establishing its validity and reliability, tested the hypotheses with empirical data from 114 companies in the retail industry. Controlling for variations of firm size and subindustry effects, our empirical analysis found a strong positive interaction effect between IT infrastructure and e-commerce capability. This suggests that their complementarity positively contributes to firm performance in terms of sales per employee, inventory turnover, and cost reduction. The results are consistent with the resource-based theory, and provide empirical evidence to the complementary synergy between front-end e-commerce capability and back-end IT infrastructure. Combined together, they become more effective in producing business value. Yet the value of this synergy has not been recognized in the IT payoff literature. The ""productivity paradox"" observed in various studies has been attributed to variation in methods and measures, yet we offer an additional explanation: ignoring complementarities in business value measurement implies that the impact of IT was seriously underestimated. Our results emphasized the integration of resources as a feasible path to e-commerce value--companies need to enhance the integration between front-end e-commerce capability and back-end IT infrastructure in order to reap the benefits of e-commerce investments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,167,202

Based on this framework, we formulate six hypotheses and identify six factors (technology readiness, firm size, global scope, financial resources, competition intensity, and regulatory environment) that may affect value creation of e-business. Survey data from 612 firms across 10 countries in the financial services industry were collected and used to test the theoretical model. To examine how e-business value is influenced by economic environments, we compare two subsamples from developed and developing countries. Based on structural equation modeling, our empirical analysis demonstrates several key findings: (1) Within the TOE framework, technology readiness emerges as the strongest factor for e-business value, while financial resources, global scope, and regulatory environment also significantly contribute to e-business value. (2) Firm size is negatively related to e-business value, suggesting that structural inertia associated with large firms tends to retard e-business value. (3) Competitive pressure often drives firms to adopt e-business, but e-business value is associated more with internal organizational resources (e.g., technological readiness) than with external pressure to adopt. (4) While financial resources are an important factor in developing countries, technological capabilities become far more important in developed countries. This suggests that as firms move into deeper stages of e-business transformation, the key determinant of e-business value shifts from monetary spending to higher dimensions of organizational capabilities. (5) Government regulation plays a much more important role in developing countries than in developed countries. These findings indicate the usefulness of the proposed research model and theoretical framework for studying e-business value. They also provide insight",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,17,54

The computer support provided was Software-Aided Meeting Management (SAMM), a system designed to support common group needs such as problem identification, alternatives generation, and alternatives evaluation. Groups were permitted to use or not use SAMM, according to their own perceived needs. Members' attitudes toward the group decision process and their perceptions of meeting quality were assessed after each meeting. As part of an academic course in which they were enrolled, the groups were required to submit a detailed report of their plans for each task; the plans were evaluated by the course instructor. Results suggested two patterns of adoption of SAMM: (1) groups that accepted the technology and used it throughout their meetings, and (2) groups that discarded the technology and ceased to use it. This paper discusses attitudinal development in these two types of groups and explores the relationship between attitudes and the quality of group planning in the SAMM environment.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1991,4,51,70

Prior work has investigated sources in isolation, but in an organizational setting, sources are encountered as an open portfolio instead of in isolation. It is important to understand how individuals perceive the wide array of sources available to them and how those perceptions affect their use of different types of sources. Building on prior work, this research looks at factors underlying the selection of sources that require direct interpersonal contact (relational sources) and those that do not (nonrelational sources) and explores factors that differentially affect the use of these types of sources. A sample of 204 working professionals recruited from graduate business studies was used to test hypotheses regarding the effects of accessibility and quality, as well as comparisons and trade-offs between relational and nonrelational sources. Consistent with prior work, source accessibility and quality significantly affect usage of a source. This relationship, however, is moderated by the type of source with accessibility having less effect on the use of relational sources. Furthermore, use of each type of source was also affected by the perceived accessibility and quality of alternative types of sources. Together these results highlight the importance of simultaneously considering the relational and nonrelational sources available to individuals. These results also have implications for the design and implementation of systems for managing information and knowledge assets.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,297,331

The majority of these approaches, however, assume a familiarity with and understanding of the organizational context by those individuals from whom requirements are to be derived. Such approaches often yield unsatisfactory results when the information system being developed involves ill-structured task contexts. The generation of a robust set of information items can be an important first step in the specification of information requirements. Scenario-based approaches to generate information items for requirements analysis appear intuitively promising as a mechanism for promoting the elicitation of information requirements for ill-structured task contexts. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding their potential effectiveness. This paper proposes the use of mental imagery as a scenario-based technique and reports on the results of an exploratory laboratory experiment that compared a mental imagery approach with goal-oriented and critical success factors approaches in the generation of information items. The results of this experiment provide modest evidence that positive and negative mental imagery protocols may both outperform goal-oriented and critical success factors approaches for ill-structured task contexts. Further, the strongest results were observed to favor the positive imagery protocol.

We draw from the literature on strategic IS planning and organizational culture to contextualize the DeLone and McLean model. There is some evidence that a high-quality information technology (IT) plan leads to system success; therefore, we empirically examine the inclusion of the IT plan quality construct as an antecedent to IS success. We also empirically examine the relationships among constructs in the model of IS success in the context of different corporate cultural types' entrepreneurial and formal. The results provide strong support for the research model and suggest that variations in IS success are explained by the quality of the IT plan and the corporate culture exhibited by a firm. We discuss implications related to our finding that IT plan quality has a greater impact on IS success in organizations that exhibit an entrepreneurial corporate culture than in those that exhibit a formal corporate culture. Furthermore, we discuss how the relationships in the DeLone and McLean model of IS success differ in diverse corporate cultural types and the meaning of these differences.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,2,267,294

CORONADO, electronic meeting systems technology adoption;  field studies;  group support systems;  qualitative research;  technology acceptance;  technology diffusion;  telecommunications technologies;  Technology transition model,"There are several thousand group support systems (GSS) installations worldwide, and, while that number is growing, GSS has not yet achieved critical mass. One reason may be that it can take one to three years for an organization to complete a transition to GSS. Studying GSS transition in the field could yield insights that would allow for faster, lower-risk transitions elsewhere. This article presents a thirty-two-month qualitative field investigation of an effort to introduce GSS into the daily work of the staff of the U.S. Navy's Commander, Third Fleet. Using the principles of action research, the project began with interventions based on the precepts of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The goal of the interventions was to engender sufficient acceptance for GSS to create a self-sustaining, growing community of GSS users. Throughout the study, building on a base of experience developed in other private- and public-sector transition projects, we revised and extended TAM based on insights that emerged in the field. The resulting model, the Technology Transition Model (TTM), frames acceptance as a multiplicative function of the magnitude and frequency of the perceived net value of a proposed change, moderated by the perceived net value associated with the transition period itself. TTF frames net value as having a number of dimensions, including cognitive, economic, political, social, affective, and physical. It posits that cognitive net value derives from at least three sources: changes in access, technical, and conceptual attention loads. GSS transition proceeded at different speeds in different segments of the Third Fleet; the intelligence and battle staffs became self-sustaining within weeks, while others are still not self-sustaining. TTM appears to explain the differences that emerged in the Navy community. The articles presents TAM, then argues the propositions of TTM. It then presents background information about Third Fleet, and describes critical incidents in the transition effort that give rise to the model. It summarizes the lessons learned in the field by comparing the differing transition trajectories among Fleet staff segments in light of the model.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,3,151,195

Performing this task typically involves consideration of both quantitative as well as qualitative aspects of projects. Research in human information processing and cognitive psychology suggests that decision makers are often subject to biases that tend to assign greater salience to quantitative as opposed to qualitative and intangible factors. To help overcome such biases and to provide flexible decision support to the project selection committee, a knowledge-based system has been developed. Knowledge captured in the system was extracted from industry practitioners responsible for the project selection decision. The system architecture represents an integration of database, modeling, and expert system capabilities. It supports both intelligence and design phases of project selection and can assess the impact of a selected portfolio on an organization's cash flow. The operation of the system is illustrated through an extended example.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,1,165,184

Yet, despite their demonstrated potential, GSS have been slow to diffuse across organizations. Drawing on the Technology Transition Model, the paper argues that the high conceptual load of GSS (i.e., understanding of the intended effect of GSS functionality) encourages organizations to employ expert facilitators to wield the technology on behalf of others. Economic and political factors mitigate against facilitators remaining long term in GSS facilities that focus on supporting nonroutine, ad hoc projects. This especially hampers scaling GSS technology to support distributed collaboration. An alternative and sustainable way for organizations to derive value from GSS lies in an approach called 'collaboration engineering': the development of repeatable collaborative processes that are conducted by practitioners themselves. To enable the development of such processes, this paper proposes the thinkLet concept, a codified packet of facilitation skill that can be applied by practitioners to achieve predictable, repeatable patterns of collaboration, such as divergence or convergence. A thinkLet specifies the facilitator's choices and actions in terms of the GSS tool used, the configuration of this tool, and scripted prompts to accomplish a pattern of collaboration in a group. Using thinkLets as building blocks, facilitators can develop and transfer repeatable collaborative processes to practitioners. Given the limited availability of expert facilitators, collaboration engineering with thinkLets may become a sine qua non for organizations to effectively support virtual work teams.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2003,4,31,64

The experiments revealed a strong user acceptance of pen-based systems for software navigation and position control across a range of applications, and showed that the responses of current nonusers were very similar to those of experienced users when using pen-based systems. The results also suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, handwriting recognition is unlikely to be widely accepted as a direct keyboard substitute for general-purpose computing. The paper discusses alternatives to handwriting recognition for pen-based character input, and ends with a brief discussion of future directions in pen-based interface research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,3,71,90

We describe a collaboration support system (CSS) that combines a computer-assisted collaboration engineering platform for creating PSAs with a process support system runtime platform for executing PSAs. We show that the CSS meets its design goals: (1) to reduce development cycles for collaboration systems, (2) to allow nonprogrammers to design and develop PSAs, and (3) to package enough expertise in the tools that nonexperts could execute a well-designed collaborative work process without training.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,159,194

The situation may result from a company's expanding needs for communication over its private or a shared network, or because a new user company is joining an existing shared network. In order to accommodate the new information flow without negatively affecting the waiting times for the previously contracted communications, network capacity may have to be expanded. We present an algorithmic method for least-cost capacity expansion of a set of network paths preselected to carry the incremental information flows. Owing to the insights gained as a result of extensive computational experiments, we then provide a simplified technique applicable to a broad class of cases. Polynomial time complexity of the algorithms included in the presented methodology points to its practicality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,5,1988,2,57,70

While interoperability has been discussed conceptually in the IS literature, few comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted to conceptualize this construct and examine it in depth. For instance, it is unclear how interoperability is formed and whether it can improve organizational performance. To fill the gap, we argue that interorganizational systems (IOS) standards are a key information technology infrastructure facilitating formation of interoperability. As an organizational ability to work with external trading partners, interoperability's development depends not only on capability building within firm boundaries but also on community readiness across firm boundaries. Using data collected from 194 organizations in the geospatial industry, we empirically confirm that interoperability is formed via these two different paths. Furthermore, our results show that interoperability acts as a mediator by enabling firms to achieve performance gains from IOS standards adoption. Our study sheds new light on formation mechanisms as well as the business value of interoperability.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,269,298

These NeuroIS studies investigate the neurophysiological effects related to the design, use, and impact of IS. A major advantage of this new methodology is its ability to examine human behavior at the underlying neurophysiological level, which was not possible before, and to reduce self-reporting bias in behavior research. Previous studies that have revisited important IS concepts such as trust and distrust have challenged and extended our knowledge. An increasing number of neuroscience studies in IS have given researchers, editors, reviewers, and readers new challenges in terms of determining what makes a good NeuroIS study. While earlier papers focused on how to apply specific methods (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging), this paper takes an IS perspective in deriving six phases for conducting NeuroIS research and offers five guidelines for planning and evaluating NeuroIS studies: to advance IS research, to apply the standards of neuroscience, to justify the choice of a neuroscience strategy of inquiry, to map IS concepts to bio-data, and to relate the experimental setting to IS-authentic situations. The guidelines provide guidance for authors, reviewers, and readers of NeuroIS studies, and thus help to capitalize on the potential of neuroscience in IS research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,211,234

Research has already determined that avatar-based communication may increase perceived interpersonal trust in anonymous online environments. Despite this trust-inducing potential of avatars, however, we hypothesize that in trust situations, people will perceive human faces differently than they will perceive avatar faces. This prediction is based on evolution theory, because throughout human history the majority of interaction among people has taken place in face-to-face settings. Therefore, unlike perception of an avatar face, perception of a human face and the related trustworthiness discrimination abilities must be part of the genetic makeup of humans. Against this background, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment based on a multiround trust game to gain insight into the differences and similarities of interactions between humans versus human interaction with avatars. Our results indicate that (1) people are better able to predict the trustworthiness of humans than the trustworthiness of avatars; (2) decision making about whether or not to trust another actor activates the medial frontal cortex significantly more during interaction with humans, if compared to interaction with avatars; this brain area is of paramount importance for the prediction of other individuals' thoughts and intentions (mentalizing), a notably important ability in trust situations; and (3) the trustworthiness learning rate is similar, whether interacting with humans or avatars. Thus, the major implication of this study is that although interaction on the Internet may have benefits, the lack of real human faces in communication may serve to reduce these benefits, in turn leading to reduced levels of collaboration effectiveness.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,83,114

Through a randomized experiment, we first confirm the theoretical predictions that participants with more social connections are less likely to invest in information acquisition from outside information sources, but perform significantly better than other participants in prediction markets. We further show that when the cost of information acquisition is low, a social network-embedded prediction market outperforms a nonnetworked prediction market. We find strong support for peer effects in prediction accuracy among participants. These results have direct managerial implications for the business practice of prediction markets and are critical to understanding how to use social networks to improve the performance of prediction markets.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,235,268

Teams that interact using text-based collaboration technology typically exchange more information than when they perform the same task face-to-face, but past results suggest that team members are more likely to ignore information they receive from others. Collaboration technology makes unique demands on individual cognitive resources that may change how individual team members process information in virtual settings compared to face-to-face settings. This experiment uses electroencephalography, electrodermal activity, and facial electromyography to investigate how team members process information received from text-based collaboration during a team decision-making process. Our findings show that information that challenges an individual's prediscussion decision preference is processed similarly to irrelevant information, while information that supports an individual's prediscussion decision preference is processed more thoroughly.

In this study, we consider both the direct sales of the advertised products and indirect sales (i.e., cross-selling) of other products, and examine how specific keywords and general keywords influence these two types of sales differently. We also examine how the cross-selling effects may vary across different types of products (main products and accessories). Our results suggest that the use of specific keywords leans toward improving the direct sales of advertised products, while the use of general keywords leans toward improving the indirect sales of other products. The contribution of keywords to indirect sales is influenced by product type. For main products, the use of specific keywords generates a higher marginal contribution to indirect sales than that of general keywords. For accessory products, the use of general keywords generates a higher marginal contribution to indirect sales than that of specific keywords. The key implication of this study is that sellers focusing on different types of sales (direct or indirect sales) or products (main or accessory products) should consider using different types of keywords in search engine advertising to drive sales.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,299,326

This research adopted multimethod empirical investigations to validate our conceptions. The first investigation used electroencephalography and a self-report survey to study quantitatively the cognitive activities of user-game engagement. The second investigation adopted the qualitative interview method to triangulate the findings from the quantitative data. This research contributes to theory in two ways, namely, conceptualizing and empirically examining user-game engagement as well as theorizing and demonstrating how the two gaming elements affect user-game engagement.

Our results show that positive and negative ""buy"" information has an asymmetric influence on attitude and intention, whereas ""like"" information has a positive influence on intention. The presence of ""buy"" information is associated with EEG activity that is generally linked to negative emotions. However, the addition of ""like"" information is associated with EEG activity that is generally linked to positive emotions. The different effects of the two types of group-buying information can be explained by the different social influences exerted by the information.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,151,178

This study develops a nomological network with an overarching view of relationships among emotions and other constructs of interest in IS research. The resulting 3-emotion systems' nomological network includes three interacting emotion systems: language, physiology, and behavior. Two laboratory experiments were conducted to test the nomological network, with six online travel service Web pages used as stimuli. The first study used paper-based self-report measures and qualitative comments, whereas the second included both self-reports and electroencephalography (EEG) measures. An outcome measure of e-loyalty was included in each study. The results of both studies showed positive and negative emotion-inducing stimuli were related to positive and negative emotions when viewing the Web sites as indicated by both self-reports and EEG data. In turn, positive and negative emotions as measured by both self-reports and EEG measures were linked to e-loyalty to some degree. This research is novel and significant because it is possibly the first in-depth study to link the study of emotions in IS with a sound theory base and multiple measurement approaches, including neuroscience measures. It shows that an EEG measure has some predictive power for an outcome such as e-loyalty. Implications of the research are that IS studies should distinguish between the different emotion systems of language and physiology, choose emotion measures carefully, and also recognize the intertwining of the emotion systems and cognitive processing.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,13,48

However, little research has been aimed at investigating the implicit (automatic or unconscious) determinants of such cognitive beliefs, and more importantly, the potential nonlinear relationships of such antecedents with explicit (perceptual) ones. As such, this paper theorizes that implicit neurophysiological states-memory load and distraction- and explicit-engagement and frustration-antecedents interact in the formation of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. To test the study's hypotheses, we conducted an experiment that measured neurophysiological states while individuals worked on instrumental and hedonic tasks using technology. The results show that, as theorized, implicit and explicit constructs interact together, and thus have a nonlinear effect on behavioral beliefs. Specifically, when engagement is high, neurophysiological distraction does not statistically significantly affect perceived usefulness, whereas when engagement is low, neurophysiological distraction has a negative and significant effect on usefulness. The results also show that when frustration is high, neurophysiological memory load has a negative effect on perceived ease of use, whereas when it is low, neurophysiological memory load has a positive effect on perceived ease of use. This study makes several contributions to acceptance research and the emerging field of NeuroIS, including demonstration of the importance of emotional perceptions for moderating the effects of neurophysiological states on behavioral beliefs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2014,4,179,210

Considering behavioral heterogeneity, we employ a factor mixture modeling technique to classify respondents into different groups that highlight distinct patterns of social learning influences. We find that the differential effects of social learning factors on obtaining and sharing persist across these groups. We further utilize demographic variables to profile members in each group for segmentation insights. From a theoretical perspective, our findings advance the understanding of music piracy and suggest the importance of separating obtaining from sharing activities when studying piracy.

This study focuses on intrafirm temporary role transitions, and more specifically on the case of information technology (IT) professionals transitioning out of a successful project and returning to their functional unit. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 IT professionals. All of the respondents reported that they had experienced an adaptation period, albeit minor for some. Others, however, felt an important re-entry shock. A shock of high magnitude is mainly experienced when the successful project becomes a referent to which all other work assignments are compared. This idealized project work environment is the result of the decisions top management makes about the project structure, management, and governance. The results show that all people do not react the same way to a shock of high magnitude: some either adapt or change their new role, but others resist. This study highlights the need to better understand role transitions by further investigating the moderating variables at play in the relationships between actor, experience, magnitude of shock, and reaction. The study contributes to practice by questioning the widely shared assumption that IT professionals effortlessly navigate between project and functional work environments, and by highlighting the need to consider successful projects as a potential source of turmoil for team members.

Prior research has established the importance of commitment to the organizational goals set by top management and a shared understanding of the goals among the project teams. However, conflicts occur among project teams due to pursuit of their own goals, their unique approaches to completion of required tasks, and their individual need for limited resources. These conflicts need to be resolved in a fashion that leads to the pursuit of program goals, not the independent goals lodged in individual projects. We develop a model of an IT program environment to study the effects of goal interdependence among projects and shared understanding of organizational goals on promoting integrative conflict management (ICM). ICM techniques yield agreement on decisions in the face of conflicting ideas. In turn, ICM promotes arrival at an agreement about implementation means and commitment to the IT program goals, which are better achieved as a result. The model presents a new perspective for research on conflict that considers the specific resolution process to be a key component in the attainment of goals. Practitioners should instill integrative conflict resolution techniques into program and project processes as a fundamental means of achieving goals critical to the organization.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,1,79,106

The evaluation indicates that with the use of MindMerger, team learning behaviors occur, and shared understanding of the tasks in complex work processes increases among experienced diverse tool and dye makers. Thus, the validated compound thinkLet MindMerger provides designers of collaborative work practices with a reusable module of activities to solve clarification issues in group work early on.

In the experiment, insider information is operationalized as signals on the state of nature with high precision. Motivated by the literature on insider information in the context of financial markets, we test and confirm two characterizations of insider information in the context of prediction markets: abnormal performance and less diffusion. Experimental results suggest that a more balanced social network structure is crucial to the success of prediction markets, whereas network structures akin to star networks are ill suited to prediction markets. As compared with other network structures, insider information has less positive effects on prediction market accuracy in star networks. We also find that the bias of the public information has a larger negative effect on prediction market accuracy in star networks.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,1,145,172

An initial study unexpectedly revealed the occurrence of rigidity in a highly controlled concealed information test setting, prompting the design and implementation of an automated rigidity detection system for interviewing. A unique experimental evaluation supported the system concept. The results of the second study confirmed the kinesic rigidity found in the first, and provided further theoretical insights explaining the rigidity phenomenon.

We theorize that firms with a posture-profile misalignment will see diminished returns from IT adoption because they will be less likely to possess (and be less effective at exploiting) crucial innovation resources when they need them most. We demonstrate how misalignment conditions the link between IT innovation adoption and organizational performance using a data set comprising electronic networking technologies in over 25,000 U.S. manufacturing plants. Productivity regression estimations reveal a consistent pattern that the association between IT innovation adoption and productivity is substantially diminished among misaligned firms. These empirical results provide initial confirmation of the theoretical value of innovation posture, innovation resource profile, and innovation posture-profile misalignment.

Drawing on social capital theory to explain how alignment affects organizational performance, we examine why common suggestions such as ""communicate more"" are insufficient to strengthen alignment and disclose how social capital between IT and business units drives alignment and ultimately IT business value. Empirical data from 136 firms confirms the profound impact of operational business-IT alignment, composed of social capital and business understanding of IT, on IT flexibility, IT utilization, and organizational performance. The results show that social capital theory is a useful theoretical foundation for understanding how business IT alignment works. The findings suggest that operational alignment is at least as important as strategic alignment for IT service quality; that managers need to focus on operational aspects of alignment beyond communication by fostering knowledge, trust, and respect; and that IT utilization and flexibility are appropriate intermediate goals for business-IT alignment governance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,1,241,272

To successfully manage these communities, organizations need to understand what roles members assume, how they communicate and vary in their contribution behavior. In this exploratory study, we investigate the heterogeneous roles of contest participants based on an international innovation-contest community. We identify six user types associated with various behavioral contribution patterns by using cluster and social network analysis. The six user types further differ in their communicative content and contribution quality. Our paper contributes to a better theoretical understanding of distinctive user types in innovation-contest communities, their role in the community, and their contribution to the success of innovation contests in the era of social software.

Over the past decades, creativity support systems (CSSs) have gained ground as a means to enhance individual, group, and organizational creativity. Whereas prior research has focused primarily on the main effects of CSSs, we explore the interaction effects with the creative ability of the individual. In this paper, we investigate the use of the case-based reasoning (CBR) technology, which is based on the principle of analogical reasoning, to aid individuals in solving business problems creatively. The expectations as to why the CBR technology should enhance individual creativity, and under what conditions (i.e., the type and number of cases that are made available), are derived from creative cognition theory, and are tested empirically. In a series of studies, a CBR system loaded with a diverse set of cases was found to enhance the performance of individuals with lower creative ability, but it did not help the most creative individuals. Although the literature suggests that cases from remote problem domains should lead to more novel solutions, loading the CBR system only with cases closely related to the problem domain proved more effective than remote cases only. Finally, loading the CBR system with a larger set of diverse cases was found to positively influence the creativity of the solutions. These findings have the following implications for CSSs and creative cognition theory: (1) when considering the effectiveness of CSSs it is important to take into account the creative ability of the individual (i.e., ""one size does not fit all""), (2) making a sufficiently large and diverse set of cases available is better for stimulating creativity, and (3) providing cases that are too remote may be counterproductive. On a practical note, organizations seeking to redesign their division of labor between individuals and machines can easily follow the CBR approach presented here using their own set of cases.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,1,309,340

We compare a physical market to a discrete electronic market in the wholesale used vehicle industry to evaluate how their different designs work for different types of transactions. We find that buyers and sellers balance adverse selection costs and other transaction costs when using the two markets, with the physical market serving as the general exchange and the electronic market serving as a spot market for vehicles with low adverse selection risk. These findings increase our understanding of how sellers and buyers distribute supply and demand between physical and electronic markets in industries in which they coexist. They also increase our understanding of how information technology can improve market function in wholesale environments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,11,46

Two innovative, all-electronic options exchanges, the International Securities Exchange (ISE) and the Boston Options Exchange (BOX), opened for trading in 2000 and 2004. In contrast to rival floor markets, they offer immediate order execution, direct user access, and reduced costs. As a result, ISE and BOX grew trading volumes and won market share from four incumbent exchanges in the United States. We observe significant differences between broker order-routing practices across ISE and BOX, leading to the markets’ different growth patterns. We develop and test hypotheses about new market growth using a panel of six years of quarterly disclosures from 24 major brokerage firms. We find that membership affiliations are the dominant force in predicting brokers’ order-routing patterns. In contrast to prior research, network externalities, as measured by an exchange’s previous quarter market share, are not significant predictors after controlling for temporal heterogeneity. From our results, executives of new electronic exchanges should concentrate on developing broker exchange affiliation and incentive schemes in order to achieve sustainable order levels. Furthermore, keeping a keen eye on the competitive landscape and reacting to changes in current and prospective competitors’ affiliation structures may prove the most beneficial way to ensure continued success. Top management must identify the relative advantages of new entrants’ affiliation structures and respond accordingly. A new entrant that provides incentives through a novel affiliation structure can be routed significant orders if the incumbent exchange does not react swiftly and effectively. The results are not limited to analyzing electronic exchanges but, we expect, to many situations where competing information technology platforms also benefit from user affiliation and network effects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,47,76

However, measurements for data reliability have not been widely established in the area of information systems (IS). This paper attempts to draw some concepts of reliability from the field of quality control and to apply them to IS. The paper develops three measurements for data reliability: internal reliability--reflects the ""commonly accepted"" characteristics of various data items; relative reliability--indicates compliance of data to user requirements; and absolute reliability--determines the level of resemblance of data items to reality. The relationships between the three measurements are discussed, and the results of a field study are displayed and analyzed.

However, paying bidding fees without receiving the auction item in return often causes high dissatisfaction among losers, resulting in heated discussions and high churn rates. To reduce these negative reactions, pay-per-bid auctioneers created the Buy-Now feature, which allows losers to put all or part of the bidding fees that they paid during an auction toward buying the auction item. Using unique data, including individual customer bidding histories and cost data from more than 6,800 pay-per-bid auctions, we find that, overall, the Buy-Now feature leads to more aggressive bidding behavior, attracts more bidders, increases loyalty, and results in a higher profit per auction. However, for voucher auctions that represent common value auctions, the Buy-Now feature causes a decrease in the number of bidders and the profit per auction, although we find an increase in the average number of bids per bidder. We also show theoretically that a bidder can pursue a risk-free bidding strategy. However, we find empirically that bidders rarely use this strategy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,77,104

In customized bundling, consumers decide the bundle’s components, and the effects of this change on consumption variety have important implications for information goods retailers. Although reduction in transaction and search costs increases supply-side product variety, customized bundling can introduce new types of friction in the consumption process. We show that customization of information good bundles reduces consumption variety through two effects: design cost effects and compromise effects. We present the results of three behavioral experiments and an empirical study using sales data from a national music retailer. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of the effects of customized bundling on search costs and demand-side dynamics. The results provide insights for information goods retailers on the effects of design and search costs on consumer purchasing behavior. Implications for the design of retail platforms for customizable information goods are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,105,132

This research examines key seller- and app-level characteristics that impact success in an app store market. We tracked individual apps and their presence in the top-grossing 300 chart in Apple’s App Store and examined how factors at different levels affect the apps’ survival in the top 300 chart. We used a generalized hierarchical modeling approach to measure sales performance, and confirmed the results with the use of a hazard model and a count regression model. We find that broadening app offerings across multiple categories is a key determinant that contributes to a higher probability of survival in the top charts. App-level attributes such as free app offers, high initial ranks, investment in less-popular (less-competitive) categories, continuous quality updates, and high-volume and high-user review scores have positive effects on apps’ sustainability. In general, each diversification decision across a category results in an approximately 15 percent increase in the presence of an app in the top charts. Survival rates for free apps are up to two times more than that for paid apps. Quality (feature) updates to apps can contribute up to a threefold improvement in survival rate as well. A key implication of the results of this study is that sellers must utilize the natural segmentation in consumer tastes offered by the different categories to improve sales performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,133,170

One new addition to this strategy is virtual gifting, whereby users purchase virtual products to give to other users. The monetary value of such virtual good transactions is economically significant but no prior study has examined this phenomenon in a strictly virtual context. We apply theory from the economics literature to examine gifting behavior in a virtual world in which users’ social status is reflected in observable social connections (friendships) and interactions (personal messages). We find strong evidence that gifting is associated with future enhancements of the gift giver’s social status, consistent with a social status–seeking motivation, thus confirming a theorized behavior that is difficult to study in the real world. Our study has implications for system proprietors and managers because we show that gift giving increases system use continuance. We identify various antecedents of gift giving, which may assist a manager in identifying users who are most inclined to give gifts and enable the manager to signal the social exchange benefits to users as a way of improving their social connections.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,171,210

Specifically, does it matter if the source of advice has a stake in the outcome of the piracy decision? Does it matter if the source of advice has a social tie with the advisee? Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents. Treatments represent various sources of piracy advice (e.g., the teen’s parent, a record label, or an external regulator). Subjects make decisions playing our new experimental game—The Piracy Game—extended from the volunteer’s dilemma literature. Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject’s parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child’s behavior. An external regulator, having no social tie or stake in the decision, provides the least credible source of advice, leading to the greatest amount of piracy. Our analyses not only provide managerial insights but also develop theoretical understanding of the role of social ties in the context of advice.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,211,244

While busesinss-to-business (B2B) technology solutions, such as CPFR (collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment), facilitate the sharing of historical information (e.g., transaction records), business intelligence (e.g., potential customer demand) is considered private. Central to CPFR is collaborative demand forecasting (CDF) that allows supply chain partners to share private demand information and incorporate the jointly derived demand forecast into production planning and product replenishment decisions. Implementing CDF, however, is a challenge because of the high costs of the laborious collaboration effort (e.g., to resolve forecast differences). Hence, companies are unable to realize the benefits of CDF and, in turn, the full potential of CPFR. Typically, the issues of information truthfulness and collaboration cost are addressed through an exception management mechanism that defines a range of forecast updates within which collaboration is automated without any human intervention in B2B trading partners. In this paper, we develop incentive-based contracts that explicitly consider the truth-telling behavior and exception resolution in decisions related to the threshold values of demand information. Our first contribution to B2B information management is in establishing the strategic value of exception management and resolution mechanisms in B2B relationships, leading to truthful revelation of demand information. Our second contribution is in developing exception-based incentive contracts, especially in light of the advances in today’s business practices and technology, to address issues associated with unobservable and asymmetric demand information. Specifically, we propose a resolution contract to coordinate the supply chain that directly incorporates both exceptions and resolution in an incentive mechanism. We show that these alternative contracts are all viable solutions in assuring truthful exchange of demand information but excel individually in specific situations and, thus, provide practitioners with alternative demand collaboration tools when price negotiation is not an option.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,245,284

Results from a survey of 539 employee users suggest that SRS engenders an emotion-focused coping response in the form of moral disengagement from ISP violations, which in turn increases one’s susceptibility to this behavior. Our multidimensional view of SRS—comprised of security-related overload, complexity, and uncertainty—offers a new perspective on the workplace environment factors that foster noncompliant user behavior and inspire cognitive rationalizations of such behavior. The study extends technostress research to the information systems security domain and provides a theoretical framework for the influence of SRS on user behavior. For practitioners, the results highlight the incidence of SRS in organizations and suggest potential mechanisms to counter the stressful effects of information security requirements.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,285,318

The benefits from a potential outsourcing relationship expansion have strategic implications for relational incentive provision. Modeling “information poaching” in IT outsourcing as an incentive problem with contractibility constraints, our analysis shows that this problem could be mitigated in a repeated game where the outsourcing client and the service provider agree on a relational contract. When the two partners share the belief that they can potentially benefit from a future relationship expansion, they are more likely to behave cooperatively during the early stages of their relationship. However, when they disagree about the likelihood of the future relationship expansion, they will have different preferences on a set of otherwise equivalent relational bonus contracts. Specifically, they will adopt a relational contract with large but infrequent bonuses when the client is more optimistic than the service provider about the potential of their relationship. Because these results hold even when the sourcing partners’ beliefs are very close to each other, our analysis sheds fresh light on the issue of equilibrium selection in relational contract theory. In the context of IT outsourcing, the results of this study suggest that, because salient forms of relational bonuses are often not adopted, relational incentive provision is likely more pervasive than what we can observe.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,2,319,350

To study this adoption process and get insights into the underlying mechanisms, in this work we synthesize the theories on social networks and knowledge transfer. We propose a research framework in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network, and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. We also propose that, in a network setting, the mechanism of knowledge transfer manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption. Using a large longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five thousand hospitals across a thirteen-year horizon, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our analysis shows that knowledge flow in provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in initial years, allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for quicker adoption in later years. Therefore, recent efforts at multiple levels to form integrated healthcare delivery networks should accelerate HIT adoption.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,7,34

Weber,"Intermediation in a Sharing Economy: Insurance, Moral Hazard, and Rent Extraction", collaborative consumption;  digital economy;  incentive contracting;  intermediation;  moral hazard;  optimal insurance;  sharing economy;  trust,"A key impediment to sharing is a lender’s concern about damage to a lent item due to unobservable actions by a renter, usually resulting in moral hazard. This paper shows how an intermediary can eliminate the moral hazard problem by providing optimal insurance to the lender and first-best incentives to the renter to exert care, as long as market participants are risk neutral. The solution is illustrated for the collaborative housing market but applies in principle to any sharing market with vertically differentiated goods. A population of renters, heterogeneous both in their preferences for housing quality and with respect to the amount of care they exert in a rental situation, face a choice between collaborative housing and staying at a local hotel. The private hosts choose their prices strategically, and the intermediary sets commission rates on both sides of the market as well as insurance terms for the rental agreement. The latter are set to eliminate moral hazard. The intermediary is able to extract the gains the hosts would earn if transacting directly. Finally, even if hotels set their prices at the outset so as to maximize collusive profits, collaborative housing persists at substantial market shares, regardless of the difference between the efficiencies of hosts and hotels to reduce renters’ cost of effort. The aggregate of hosts, intermediary, and hotels benefits from (a variety in) these effort costs, which indicates that the intermediated sharing of goods is an economically viable, robust phenomenon.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,35,71

We integrate perspectives from neoinstitutional economics and the information-processing view (IPV) of the firm. We argue that the governance structure in BPO is chosen not only to address opportunism concerns arising from relational uncertainty to and encourage cooperation, as suggested by institutional economics, but also as an informational response to task and relational uncertainty to encourage coordination between exchange partners. Using the lens of IPV, we posit that uncertainty in the outsourced task increases the information requirements (IR) of the BPO relationship, which, in turn, leads to more hierarchical governance structures. We also suggest that in addition to directly influencing governance choice, relational uncertainty, a key construct in transaction cost economics (TCE), increases IR, and hence has an indirect impact on governance choice. Furthermore, we hypothesize that technological capabilities enable more hierarchical governance in response to increasing IR needs. Data on 130 BPO initiatives provide empirical support for our hypotheses regarding the drivers of IR, its impact on governance choice, and the moderating role of technological capabilities. Our study contributes to theory by integrating the premises of TCE and IPV in the context of BPO, and to practice by underscoring the need to consider information requirements in designing appropriate coordination and collaboration processes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,72,105

However, the ability to detect when a person is hiding important information would have high value in many other applications if results could be reliably obtained using an automated and rapid interviewing system. Unfortunately, this ideal has thus far been stymied by practical limitations and inadequate scientific control in current interviewing systems. This study proposes a new class of systems, termed autonomous scientifically controlled screening systems (ASCSS), designed to detect individuals’ purposely hidden information about target topics of interest. These hidden topics of interest could cover a wide range, including knowledge of concealed weapons, privacy violations, fraudulent organizational behavior, organizational security policy violations, preemployment behavioral intentions, organizational insider threat, leakage of classified information, or even consumer product use information. ASCSS represent a systematic synthesis of structured interviewing, orienting theory, defensive response theory, noninvasive psychophysiological measurement, and behavioral measurement. To evaluate and enhance the design principles, we built a prototype automated screening kiosk system and configured it for a physical security screening scenario in which participants constructed and attempted to smuggle a fake improvised explosive device. The positive results provide support for the proposition that ASCSS may afford more widespread application of credibility assessment screening systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,106,137

The Impact of User Characteristics on Online Trust, e-business;  online trust;  trust cues;  web user characteristics;  website signaling,"Previous research suggests that user characteristics such as web experience and demographics may affect online trust. Drawing on social cognitive theory, we explore the moderating effect of user characteristics on online trust. Based on a survey of German Internet users, we differentiate three groups by age, web experience, and education. We term these groups digital natives, digital immigrants, and naturalized digitals. A multiple-group analysis reveals significant differences in trust formation, particularly in the cues considered in the evaluation of online services. Whereas a large user base inspires confidence in digital natives, naturalized digitals are more geared toward familiar brands and recommendations. Digital immigrants most critically weigh the risks of a transaction against its benefits. We argue that specific user characteristics are associated with distinct cognitive schemata, implying distinct interests and evaluations in online transactions. Online services should differentiate their signaling efforts according to the targeted customer group.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,138,171

Yet, failure to garner participation, in terms of both quantity and quality, prevents the realization of their benefits. In this regard, prior research has suggested different antecedents for the quantity and quality of participation in online forums, but without systematically considering their differences. To address this research gap, in this study we develop a theoretical model to explain the antecedents of quantity and quality of OPDF participation and test the model using a survey and content analysis of forum logs. The results indicate that quantity of participation is enhanced by the information-technology-enabled resource factor of communality but negatively influenced by collective incentives. In contrast, the antecedents of the quality of participation include both motivational and resource factors. Furthermore, communality accentuates the perceived collective incentives and persuasion benefit of participation. This study contributes to the research by proposing and testing a theoretical model that explains the different antecedents of the quantity and quality of participation in OPDFs. More broadly, the findings inform research and practice on how outcomes of web-enabled cocreation, such as those generated through OPDF participation, can be evaluated and enhanced in these online communities.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,172,212

To understand users’ active behaviors on an SNS, it is important that we identify and classify various types of online behaviors before measuring them. In this paper we holistically examine users’ active behaviors on an SNS. Toward this end, we conduct three studies. First, we classify active behaviors on an SNS into four categories using the Delphi method. Then, we develop a measurement model and validate it using the data collected from an online survey of 477 SNS users. The measures of the developed instrument exhibit satisfactory reliability and validity and are used as indicators of the latent constructs. This instrument is then used in a predictive model based on commitment theory and tested using data from 1,242 responses. The results of data analysis suggest that affective commitment and continuance commitment are good predictors of overall active behavior on an SNS. This study complements the existing research on social media, cocreation, and social commerce. Most important, this study provides a theoretically sound measurement instrument that addresses the complex characteristic of overall active behavior on an SNS and which should be useful for future research.

Some IBPs have recently branched into content delivery network (CDN) services; separately, other ISPs have started offering on-demand video streaming to compete with pure-play content providers. These developments have intensified the competition in both content delivery and media-streaming markets. For the content delivery market, we study the competition equilibriums by analyzing factors such as market share, cost structure, service pricing, and subscriber preference. Our approach helps identify conditions under which a content provider should choose an IBP over the incumbent CDN for content distribution. We also show how an IBP’s CDN venture affects its interconnection relationship with ISPs. For the streaming service market, we examine conditions under which a content provider would partner with an ISP to lower operating and marketing costs while providing a more streamlined subscriber experience. Analytically, our game-theoretical models can optimize key contracting and pricing strategies for multiple classes of service providers; empirically, insights derived from the proposed models have anticipated events that coincide with several recent developments in content delivery and streaming service markets.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,254,286

Although extant literature explains why individuals in IT would act unethically in many situations, we know surprisingly little about what causes them to do so during the creative act of programming. To address this issue, we look at the reuse of Internet-accessible code: software source code legally available for gratis download from the Internet. Specifically, we scrutinize the reasons why individuals would unethically reuse such code by not checking or purposefully violating its accompanying license obligations, thus risking harm for their employer. By integrating teleological and deontological ethical judgments into a theory of planned behavior model—using elements of expected utility, deterrence, and ethical work climate theory—we construct an original theoretical framework to capture individuals’ decision-making process leading to the unethical reuse of Internet-accessible code. We test this framework with a unique survey of 869 professional software developers. Our findings advance the theoretical and practical understanding of ethical behavior in information systems. We show that programmers use consequentialist ethical judgments when carrying out creative tasks and that ethical work climates influence programmers indirectly through their peers’ judgment of what is appropriate behavior. For practice, where code reuse promises substantial efficiency and quality gains, our results highlight that firms can prevent unethical code reuse by informing developers of its negative consequences, building a work climate that fosters compliance with laws and professional codes, and making sure that excessive time pressure is avoided.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,287,325

Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the app themselves before purchase. These findings extend understanding of the freemium business model to include a market characterized by simultaneous intramarket competition for both the freemium and paid products and demonstrate how such dynamics may influence sales of the paid products.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2014,3,326,354

In this study, we first developed and validated a novel paradigm suitable for use with event-related potentials (ERPs) in scenario-based laboratory experiments of decision making in the context of information security. We then used this paradigm to examine the association between individual differences in self-control and ERPs elicited while individuals deliberated over violations of information security policies. Our results show that the left and right hemispheres of the brain were involved in decision making, and that the participants with low self-control had lower levels of neural recruitment in both hemispheres relative to those with high self-control. This was especially the case for regions in or near the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior frontal cortex (IFC). These results extend the findings in neuroscience literature related to the role of self-control in decision making in general, and validate a new paradigm for use with the electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) technique to examine theoretical questions in information security and criminology research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,6,48

While there is a growing body of work on this phenomenon, we notice several gaps, limitations, and inconsistencies in the literature. In order to further understand this complex phenomenon and reconcile past findings, we conduct an exploratory study to uncover the nomological network of key constructs salient to this phenomenon, and the nature of their interrelationships. Using a scenario-based study of young adult participants, and both linear and nonlinear analyses, we uncover key nuances of this phenomenon of unethical IT use. We find that unethical IT use is a complex phenomenon, often characterized by nonlinear and idiosyncratic relationships between the constructs that capture it. Overall, ethical beliefs held by the individuals, along with economic, social, and technological considerations are found to be relevant to this phenomenon. In terms of practical implications, these results suggest that multiple interventions at various levels may be required to combat this growing threat to IS security.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,49,87

In this paper, we explain flash crashes as the result of actions made by rational agents. We argue that the advancement of information technology (IT), which has long been associated with competitive advantages, may cause ambiguities with respect to the game form that give rise to a hypergame. We employ hypergame theory to demonstrate that a market crash constitutes an equilibrium state if players misperceive the true game. Once the ambiguity is resolved, prices readjust to the appropriate level, creating the characteristic flash-crash effect. By analyzing the interaction with herd behavior, we find that flash crashes may be an unavoidable systemic problem of modern financial markets.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,88,108

Existing anti-phishing tools lack the accuracy and generalizability needed to protect Internet users and organizations from the myriad of attacks encountered daily. Consequently, users often disregard these tools’ warnings. In this study, using a design science approach, we propose a novel method for detecting phishing websites. By adopting a genre theoretic perspective, the proposed genre tree kernel method utilizes fraud cues that are associated with differences in purpose between legitimate and phishing websites, manifested through genre composition and design structure, resulting in enhanced anti-phishing capabilities. To evaluate the genre tree kernel method, a series of experiments were conducted on a testbed encompassing thousands of legitimate and phishing websites. The results revealed that the proposed method provided significantly better detection capabilities than state-of-the-art anti-phishing methods. An additional experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of the genre tree kernel technique in user settings; users utilizing the method were able to better identify and avoid phishing websites, and were consequently less likely to transact with them. Given the extensive monetary and social ramifications associated with phishing, the results have important implications for future anti-phishing strategies. More broadly, the results underscore the importance of considering intention/purpose as a critical dimension for automated credibility assessment: focusing not only on the “what” but rather on operationalizing the “why” into salient detection cues.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,109,157

While prior research has explored factors that influence knowledge contribution in such networks, less is understood about the process by which individuals evaluate and ultimately adopt knowledge from ENPs. This study examines the process of knowledge filtering in online ENP forums. Drawing from dual process and information-evaluation theories, we hypothesize that performance on a knowledge-filtering task will be influenced by the constancy and directionality of search patterns employed by knowledge seekers. Hypotheses are tested in an experiment that utilized an eye tracker to record gaze data from professional software developers using an experimental ENP forum. By combining information-evaluation and dual process theory perspectives, our results deepen the insights offered in extant information-processing literature by showing that higher filtering accuracy is associated with (a) constant evaluation of some types of information attributes (solution content) but not others (peripheral cues), and (b) increasing attribute-based processing over time.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,158,181

However, digital information goods have a number of important differences from consumable goods that may impact variety-seeking behavior. In three experiments, we address two general research questions. First, as a precursor to studying digital goods, we disentangle the role of bundle cohesion (i.e., item relatedness) from the role of timing (simultaneous vs. sequential choice) as factors in variety seeking with consumable goods. Next, based on differences between digital and consumable goods, we theorize differences in the behavioral effects of bundle cohesion and timing on variety preferences for digital goods. The results show a reduction of influences upon variety-seeking behavior with digital goods, providing important implications for the sellers of such goods in contrast to what has been suggested for consumable goods. Therefore, a key takeaway is that, for digital goods such as music, the use of consumer-driven bundling variations does not suggest an advantage in terms of their ability to affect consumers’ variety-seeking behavior.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,182,212

The experimental results show that restricted interaction, which deprives users of part of the interactive product experience, is more enticing than both the noninteractive and fully interactive design for users with more product-class knowledge. In addition, restricted interaction is generally as good as full interaction in engaging users. Both engagement and enticement positively affect users’ purchase intentions. This study contributes to the information systems literature by extending the theory in curiosity formation to the interaction design context and advocating designs for enticement. It contributes to design practice by revealing that less interactive and less costly presentations can be more effective in attracting consumers toward the products.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,213,242

To explore this question, we model the strategic behavior of customers who make repeated purchases at two competing firms: one that provides personalized recommendations and another that does not. When a customer intends to purchase a product, she obtains recommendations from the personalizing firm and uses this recommendation to eventually purchase from one of the firms. The personalizing firm profiles the customer (based on past purchases) to recommend products. Hence, if a customer purchases less frequently from the personalizing firm, the recommendations made to her become less relevant. While considering the impact on the quality of recommendations received, a customer must balance two opposing forces: (1) the lower price charged by the non-personalizing firm, and (2) an additional fit cost incurred when purchasing from the non-personalizing firm and the increased cost due to recommendations of reduced quality in the future. An outcome of the analysis is that the customers should distribute their purchases across both firms to maximize surplus over a planning horizon. Anticipating this response, the firms simultaneously choose prices. We study the sensitivity of the equilibrium prices and profits of the firms with respect to the effectiveness of the recommender system and the profile deterioration rate. We also analyze some interesting variants of the base model in order to study how its key results could be influenced. One of the key takeaways of this research is that the recommender system can influence the price and profit of not only the personalizing firm but also the non-personalizing firm.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,243,277

On any given day, an experienced information systems (IS) researcher can map out a new 25-year research stream in under an hour. Little academic credit is therefore warranted for conceiving an idea and writing it up. Full marks are due, however, for shepherding a technical innovation through the last research mile from inspiration to implementation in the workplace. The last research mile means using academic knowledge to solve real problems for real people with a real stake in the outcome. This is the definition of applied science/engineering. The last research mile is where academia creates value for society. It leads through rich country that can yield exciting exploratory, theoretical, experimental, and technical contributions. The goal of IS research is to provide optimally relevant, timely, accurate, and complete information to decision makers at minimal cost. Cost, in this context, signifies more than just money. People ascribe value along a number of dimensions, among them economic, political, social, cognitive, emotional, and physical. IS solutions must therefore be not only technically feasible but also economically, politically, socially, cognitively, emotionally, and physically acceptable to stakeholders. These aspects of feasibility and value interact in complex ways. Moving a technological innovation from conception to adoption is therefore a task of such complexity that it is not possible to anticipate from the desk chair how a technology will  have to be realized so it can diffuse into common use. Because of this complexity, there may be many more ways to implement a technically sound solution than to implement an acceptable solution. To discover and address these issues, we must travel the last research mile. The last research mile begins when a research team finds real people with a real problem in a real organization. They explore the problem, learn about stakeholder goals, and seek to discover drivers and constraints in the problem environment. They propose possible solutions to stakeholders and listen carefully to their responses. Eventually, they build a proof of concept prototype that may not be scalable, and may not be full featured, but is sufficiently robust that stakeholders can try it out with sample tasks so both the researchers and the stakeholders can learn more about the challenges they face. A proof of concept prototype demonstrates that a solution may be technically possible. Proof of concept researchers begin to stumble upon nuggets of knowledge that give them a better sense of the issues at hand. However, proof of concept is the beginning, not the end, of the last research mile. Research that ends with proof of concept is impoverished compared to that which carries forward to the second step---proof of value. In the proof of value step, researchers design a prototype with sufficient robustness and functionality to solve at least one important real-world problem. They take the proof of value prototype into the lab and out to the field so stakeholders can try to use it for real work, with the support of the research team if necessary. The pace of academic discovery accelerates as political, social, cognitive, and emotional factors surrounding the problem and the solution interact in unexpected ways. Unexamined assumptions surface and unanticipated requirements emerge as the research team gains technical and domain expertise while trying to determine whether the solution achieves its design objectives and creates value for its users. New phenomena are discovered, described, and classified. Deeper understandings of the problem space may be synthesized into correlative grounded models. Theoretical insights may be derived to explain effects that only emerge when people try to do real work. If proof of value studies show the new technology to be superior to prior solutions, then the technology itself may become a contribution to applied science. There is still much more to be learned, however, in the third and final step of the last research mile---proof of use. In the proof of use step, a research team creates a full-featured, robust proof of use prototype than can be deployed to user environments to address not just one specific problem, but a class of problems. Researchers turn the technology over to stakeholders to see whether it is possible to create a self-sustaining and growing community of users around the solution. The lack of a thriving user community is prima facie evidence that the positive findings from proof of value studies are being overwhelmed by other, previously unsuspected issues. Further exploratory, experimental, and theoretical research may be required to discover and explain these issues. Nuggets of knowledge from earlier work may integrate into a unified understanding of the problem domain. Further applied research may draw on these new understandings to produce a system that delivers the potential value of the technology in a form that users can accept and use. This Special Section includes three papers pertaining to the last research mile. The paper ‘Embodied Conversational Agent-Based Kiosk for Automated Interviewing,’ by Jay F. Nunamaker Jr., Douglas C. Derrick, Aaron C. Elkins, Judee K. Burgoon, and Mark W. Patton, presents work that is entering the proof of value stage. The team has created an automated kiosk that uses an embodied intelligent agent---an animated human face backed by biometric sensors and intelligent agents---to interview people at national borders and to detect changes in arousal, behavior, and cognitive effort that may signal deception or malevolent intent. The paper reports three studies that evaluate separate aspects of the system and explains how findings were used as foundational research for the development of the automated kiosk that can be tested in the field. In their paper, ‘A Global Model of Technological Utilization Based on Governmental, Business-Investment, Social, and Economic Factors,’ James B. Pick and Rasool Azari  use inductive logic to derive a conceptual model of the factors of governmental support and openness, business and technology investment, and socioeconomic levels that are posited to influence technological utilization. This model is of particular interest to researchers working on proof of use challenges. They use the model to guide an exploratory test of the model on a large sample of country data from the World Bank and World Economic Forum. Based on their findings, the authors propose policy steps for the governments of developed and developing countries. Finally, Stefan Werner Knoll and Graham Horton address specific proof of use challenges in the arena of collaboration engineering in their paper, ‘Changing the Perspective: Using a Cognitive Model to Improve thinkLets for Ideation.’ The collaboration engineering research community has been working to codify collaboration expertise in a form that nonexperts can reuse without extensive training, and so derive benefits from collaboration technology that were previously only available to those supported by a professional facilitator. This paper focuses on making improvements to idea generation and sharing techniques. It uses a cognitive model to analyze 101 idea generation techniques with regard to the underlying mental principles that stimulate the ideation process. The authors identify three changes of perspective based on these principles and demonstrate how these principles can be used to improve the applicability of information technology to group processes. An earlier version of each of the papers in the Special Section earned a best paper award at the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences. Each represents a challenging and interesting perspective. We commend them to your reading.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,13,16

The Impact of Relationship Characteristics and Online Social Network Features on Loneliness, social media;  online social networks;  loneliness;  relationship management;  communal orientation;  social exchange theory;  self-disclosure;  networking ability,"In contemporary society, many people move away from their personal networks for extended periods to reach professional and/or educational goals. This separation can often lead to feelings of loneliness, which can be stressful and sometimes debilitating for the individual. We seek to understand how a person’s use of online social networks (OSNs)—technology-enabled tools that assist users with creating and maintaining their relationships—might affect their perceptions of loneliness. Prior research has offered mixed results about how OSNs affect loneliness—reporting both positive and negative effects. We argue in this study that a clearer perspective can be gained by taking a closer look at how individuals approach their relationship management in OSNs. Building on theoretical works on loneliness, we develop a model to explain the effects of relationship characteristics (i.e., relationship orientation, self-disclosure, and networking ability) and OSN features (i.e., active or passive) on perceived loneliness. Our findings show that OSN can be linked to both more and less perceived loneliness, that is, individuals’ relationship orientation significantly affects their feelings of loneliness, which are further moderated by their degree of self-disclosure within the OSN. Furthermore, how users engage in the OSN (either actively or passively) influences their perceptions of loneliness. Practical implications regarding perceived loneliness include recommendations for firms to encourage mobile workers to utilize OSNs when separated from others, for education providers to connect with their new students before they arrive, and for users to utilize OSNs as a social bridge to others they feel close with.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,278,310

Cooper,Understanding the Influence of Instant Messaging on Ending Concessions During Negotiations, instant messaging;  audio;  selfishness;  agreement;  ending concession;  self-interest;  deindividuation;  media;  negotiation experiment;  lottery;  negative reciprocation,"In many online price negotiations, instant messaging (IM) and audio channels rival each other in use, but IM’s use is on the rise. In these contexts, people who are strangers to each other are inclined to act more competitively. They are driven by self-interest and strive for greater gains from agreement in the form of what is termed “ending concessions.” To date, however, researchers have focused on striving for agreement as the main goal of negotiators. This study uses a selfishness theory to explain how individuals using IM, as compared to those using audio, can encourage their negotiation partners to make ending concessions, and thereby increase individuals’ gains when agreement is reached. We use data from a negotiation laboratory experiment to test a model of ending concessions that is predicted by unrestricted offers and comments that negotiators make over IM and audio. We base our analyses on the contents of the resulting communications. The objects of negotiation are simulated lottery tickets. Our results provide three key insights. First, when using IM, partners appear to interpret offers that include concessions from individuals as attempts to manipulate partners into accepting non-equitable agreements; as a result partners decrease their ending concessions. These interpretations do not appear to occur when using audio, and as a result individuals’ concessions do not decrease partners’ ending concessions. Second, using IM, when individuals disagree with anger directed at partners’ bidding behaviors, partners respond by increasing their ending concessions. Ending concessions are further increased when using audio. Third, and in contrast, using IM, when individuals disagree with emotion that does not include anger, partners respond by decreasing their ending concessions. Ending concessions are further decreased when using audio. These insights provide guidance for practice, and are bases for future research on the use of IM and audio for negotiation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,31,2015,4,311,342

Thus, it is important for IT groups in organizations to understand how to deal with such difficulties for improved outsourcing performance. We study whether firms learn over time to deal with these two related but distinct issues in IT and business process outsourcing. Does such learning affect financial value appropriation through outsourcing? We build on the literature in information systems and strategy to investigate whether value creation in outsourcing depends on relational learning that results from prior association with the vendor, and procedural learning that results from prior experience in managing interfirm relationships. We estimate value in terms of long-term abnormal stock returns to the client relative to an industry, size, and book-to-market matched sample of control firms following the implementation of the outsourcing contract. We also analyze announcement period returns and allied wealth effects. Using data from the hundred largest outsourcing deals between 1996 and 2005, we find that whereas relational learning influences value creation in both simple and complex outsourcing engagements, procedural learning impacts value only in complex initiatives. Financial markets are slow to price the value of learning. The results suggest that caution should be exercised when firms without the experience of managing interfirm relationships externalize complex tasks to vendors they have not worked with in the past. Furthermore, IT groups can help improve learning-based outcomes by developing processes and systems that enable a firm to improve outsourcing procedures in a cumulative manner and also to coordinate and collaborate with the vendor.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,9,38

Disruptive innovation theory offers explanations for why companies succeed or fail to respond to disruptive innovations. This study builds on disruptive innovation theory by ascertaining the role of dynamic capabilities in the performance of response to digital disruption. Empirical results suggest that first-order dynamic capabilities that are created by changing, extending, or adapting a firm’s existing resources, processes, and values are positively associated with building digital platform capabilities, and that these capabilities impact the performance of response to digital disruption. For information systems (IS) researchers, this study clarifies the role of first-order dynamic capabilities in responding to digital disruption. For IS practice, it helps managers to focus on the most promising factors for creating first-order dynamic capabilities, for building digital platform capabilities, and for reinventing their core functions to accelerate digitization.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,39,81

Sentry activities are designed to regulate the inflow of external information to the project teams and guard activities are designed to manage the outflow of teams’ information and resources to external sources. The use of sentry and guard activities has been examined in teams in other contexts such as new product development, but their role and relationship to performance in software development teams is not well understood. We hypothesize and test curvilinear relationships between these activities and knowledge integration in vendor development teams. We also examine how these effects vary under conditions of greater project uncertainty. We tested the hypotheses using data from 139 vendor development teams drawn from sixteen Indian software companies. Results highlight complex curvilinear associations among sentry and guard activities, and knowledge integration, which are further impacted by the level of uncertainty that the project team faces. We recommend that carefully calibrating sentry and guard processes will help vendor development teams enhance project outcomes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,82,115

However, key aspects of OSS such as the determinants of project success and motivations of developers in joining these projects are not well understood. Based on organizational theory, we propose that OSS activities of patch development and feature request can be classified as exploitation (implementation-oriented) and exploration (innovation-oriented) activities, respectively. We empirically examine how the structure of social network affects the success of patch-development and feature-request networks in OSS projects, using a data set collected from the SourceForge database. Our results provide empirical support for the view that patch development and feature request are exploitation and exploration activities, respectively. Network structures differ due to team formation differences and have a differential impact on development success based on the type of activity. The concepts of ambidextrous developers and ambidexterity are explored in the context of OSS projects. Collectively, our results indicate that studying OSS projects at the artifact level could improve our understanding of OSS project success and team formation. This, in turn, could lead to better management of OSS projects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,116,150

We tested our research model in a laboratory experiment with four temporal distance conditions. Results show that the direct associations between temporal distance and team performance are substantially diminished when we enter the intervening team communication variables (communication frequency and turn-taking) into the analysis model. We find that communication frequency and turn-taking have differentiated effects on conveyance of information and convergence on its meaning. Conveyance is positively associated with production speed, whereas convergence is positively associated with higher product quality (i.e., accuracy). These findings speak to the theoretical significance of communication patterns and information exchange behaviors in dispersed team research. They also transcend the common wisdom that temporal distance is good for speed and bad for quality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,151,191

Galletta,"Lost in Cyberspace: The Impact of Information Scent and Time Constraints on Stress, Performance, and Attitudes Online", human–computer interaction;  information scent;  Internet;  latent semantic analysis;  online anxiety;  online stress,"As competition online increases, website owners investigate ways in which they can attract and retain more users. One avenue is to reduce frustration and stress for the users. Furthermore, many website users are rushed when browsing for specific information on a website. To save time and prevent frustration, website owners should try to maximize information scent, that is, visual, audio, and semantic cues that are meant to lead or guide the user to his or her informational goal. This paper presents and tests a model to predict how information scent can reduce the amount of stress that consumers experience when seeking information under time constraints. The study also demonstrates the relationships between information scent, time constraints, stress, performance, and attitudes toward the website. Results demonstrate that high information scent is an important design goal for a website, and latent semantic analysis can be a useful tool for measuring scent. In addition, rather than an attribute of an overall site, the concept of scent is demonstrated to be dependent on both the website and the task(s) being performed by the user. This finding demonstrates that to maximize users’ satisfaction and ability to accomplish their goals, website designers need to determine what tasks users need to accomplish, and to make sure that the links on each page point clearly to the appropriate destination to meet those goals. The latent semantic analysis tool can provide an indication of strength and clarity of the links. Clear links gain even more importance when considering the time constraints of users. Measurable stress explains some of the variance in performance and attitudes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,192,224
267, Alexander Benlian,Web Personalization Cues and Their Differential Effects on User Assessments of Website Value, field experiment;  online news aggregators;  perceived enjoyment;  personalization cues;  preference fit;  web personalization;  website stickiness;  website value;  willingness to pay,"Although various kinds of personalization cues are pervasively used on websites, previous research studies have treated web personalization primarily as a coarse-grained, monolithic block (e.g., by comparing personalization vs. nonpersonalization or personalization vs. privacy) rather than as a combination of salient types of personalization cues that may create—either jointly or separately—different effects on user assessments of website value. Based on the stimulus–organism–response framework, we develop a research model that proposes users’ preference fit and perceived enjoyment as two key intervening mechanisms that carry over the differential effects of content and design personalization cues on users’ willingness to stick to a website and to pay for website offerings. In a field experiment with 206 subjects using a real-life news aggregator website, our findings provide evidence in support of different effect paths emanating from content and design personalization cues. Furthermore, we show that the effects of content personalization cues on website stickiness and users’ willingness to pay (WTP) are mediated by both preference fit and perceived enjoyment, whereas design personalization cues exert their effects on website stickiness only through perceived enjoyment. Counter to intuition, we find that a combination of content and design personalization cues is ineffective—or even counterproductive—in increasing preference fit and users’ WTP above and beyond the levels generated by content cues alone. With regard to perceived enjoyment and website stickiness, however, content and design personalization cues exhibit synergistic properties indicating that the combination of both cues are more than the sum of the individual cues alone. Recommendations are provided as to how online managers and web designers can use web personalization cues to positively influence website stickiness and to strengthen their digital business model.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,225,260

This Special Section focuses on the interplay of many issues arising when people work together to achieve high-value goals on a global scale. In order to build efficient, effective, and useful global systems, we must accommodate the needs of distributed cross-cultural teams. Among other things, we must establish verifiable, yet defensible, online identities that travel securely across geographic and electronic space. We must accommodate myriad genres for data streams and documents. We must find new ways to direct and focus attention, to forge new representations of familiar entities, to reason together, to negotiate and to build consensus, to hold one another accountable. Within this general context, the seven papers in this Special Section address challenges of importance and interest to global information systems (IS) endeavors. Consider, for example, the challenge of managing and controlling global information technology (IT) resources. Madhu T. Rao, Carol V. Brown, and William C. Perkins examine the utility of resource dependence theory in the context of global control and coordination of a distributed IS management function among 54 headquarters—subsidiary pairs spread across 19 countries in their paper, ""Host Country Resource Availability and Information System Control Mechanisms in Multinational Corporations: An Empirical Test of Resource Dependence Theory."" They report intriguingly mixed findings—some aspects of the theory were borne out in the field, while others were not. The next paper, ""Interoperability of E-Government Information Systems: Issues of Identification and Data Sharing,"" by Benoît Otjacques, Patrik Hitzelberger, and Fernand Feltz, deals with the sensitive legal and administrative challenges to exchanging information about the identities of individuals within a particular national entity and across international borders. This exploratory paper describes the status quo for such practices among 18 of the member states of the European Union. The insights derived here may be useful on a broader scale, as the European Union is a leader in identity protection. Dongsong Zhang, Paul Benjamin Lowry, Lina Zhou, and Xiaolan Fu examine  the degree to which global differences affect the efforts of cross-cultural teams in their paper, ""The Impact of Individualism--Collectivism, Social Presence, and Group Diversity on Group Decision Making Under Majority Influence."" The authors investigate how national culture, social presence, and group diversity may correlate with majority influence in a group decision-making context. The paper reports a study of 183 groups which revealed that the ability of a majority to impose its will on a minority varied significantly by culture. The paper offers useful insights for improving the outcome and the effectiveness of group decision making in cross-cultural environments. Carsten Østerlund, in his paper, ""Genre Combinations: A Window into Dynamic Communication Practices,"" investigates a global phenomenon as he explores the interplay of policy and action in a case study of how organizational members strike a balance between the need for continuity in communicative practices and a need for flexibility in managing a jumble of paper-based and digital IS. Using an emergency room as a rich exemplar, he presents case study data to illustrate that end users often adapt a genre’s media and form in new ways to achieve their ends. John Hulland, Michael R. Wade, and Kersi D. Antia consider an aspect of the global electronic marketplace in their paper, ""The Impact of Capabilities and Prior Investments on Online Channel Commitment and Performance,"" which examines a proposed correlation between prior network infrastructure investments and commitment to online marketing channels. As the paper draws on a resource-based view of the firm, it makes a cross-disciplinary argument to explain the commitment and performance benefits that firms derive from their prior investments. The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach with a survey of 550 online retailers. They report some interesting variation in the degree to which rewards vary unequally across firms. One of the biggest barriers to participation in the global economy is a lack of knowledge about how to conduct collaborative business processes on line. Every aspect of business collaboration incorporates some element of ideation, and many studies have been published about ways to improve idea generation. Bruce A. Reinig, Robert O. Briggs, and Jay F. Nunamaker Jr., in their paper, ""On the Measurement of Ideation Quality,"" report having discovered fundamental flaws in the metrics used to evaluate ideation approaches. The study shows that the same data set would yield three mutually exclusive conclusions depending on which of the metrics was applied. The paper therefore calls into question earlier ideation research based on the biased metrics (including that of the authors). It argues further that the one logically sound metric nonetheless has certain limitations, and proposes an approach to developing new metrics to overcome those constraints. Finally, the line between the global and the local all but vanishes in the paper ""Attention Issues in Spatial Information Systems: Directing Mobile Users’ Visual Attention Using Augmented Reality,"" by Frank Biocca, Charles Owen, Arthur Tang, and Corey Bohil. The paper tackles a special challenge faced by people who must collaborate with respect to three-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space that one or more of the participants do not actually occupy. Collocated team members use gestures, facial expressions, eye gaze, and proximity to direct the attention of their teammates to objects situated in three-dimensional spaces. These same mechanisms are not available to those who do not occupy the same space. This paper presents an elegant and deceptively simple solution to that challenge. Each of the papers in this Special Section grew out work that was nominated for best-paper awards at the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS). The paper by Biocca, Owen, Tang, and Bohil won the best-paper award for the HICSS track on Collaboration Systems and Technologies in 2006. Each paper presents an important and provocative perspective on how people may succeed as they work together toward their goals. We commend each of them to your reading.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2007,4,7,9
269, Kexin Zhao;  Xia Zhao;  Jing Deng,Online Price Dispersion Revisited: How Do Transaction Prices Differ from Listing Prices?, listing prices;  online markets;  online prices;  price dispersion;  transaction prices,"Price dispersion of a homogeneous product reflects market efficiency and has significant implications on sellers’ pricing strategies. Two different perspectives, the supply and demand perspectives, can be adopted to examine this phenomenon. The former focuses on listing prices posted by sellers, and the latter uses transaction prices that consumers pay to obtain the product. However, no prior research has systematically compared both perspectives, and it is unclear whether different perspectives will generate different insights. Using a unique data set collected from an online market, we find that the dispersion of listing prices is three times higher than the dispersion of transaction prices. More interestingly, the drivers of price dispersion differ significantly between listing and transaction data. The dispersion of listing prices reflects sellers’ perception of market environment and their pricing strategies, and it may not fully capture consumer behavior manifested through the variation of transaction prices. Our study indicates that the difference in perspectives taken on the online prices yields different results as to their dispersion.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,261,290
270, Dan Ma,Push or Pull? A Website’s Strategic Choice of Content Delivery Mechanism, competition;  e-commerce;  game theory;  information economics;  online content delivery;  RSS,"Really simple syndication (RSS) technology enables an alternative delivery mechanism for online content. Instead of waiting passively for users to pull online content out, websites can push it to potential users through RSS. This is expected to significantly affect user behavior, website profitability, and market equilibrium. This research uses an economic model to study the impact of RSS adoption and examine whether it increases a website’s profit and competitive advantage. The findings are intriguing: they demonstrate that RSS can either increase or decrease website profit. In a competitive context, RSS adoption can actually be a disadvantage; in some cases, it hurts the adopter but benefits the competitor. Moreover, under certain conditions, the first mover will be worse off when the competitor mimics its adoption decision, which discourages the earlier adoption and thus creates an obstacle to using RSS. Derivation of the adoption equilibria in sequential and simultaneous games shows that multiple market outcomes may result. Finally, regardless of whether or not a website operator adopts RSS, it will still benefit by increasing user awareness of RSS technology, but only up to a certain level. Once this critical awareness level has been reached, websites will not gain by continuing to promote RSS to users. As a whole, these results show how technology adoption will have an impact on firm performance and market outcome, and illustrate the complexity of technology adoption strategy in a competitive setting.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,291,321
271, Huigang Liang;  Zeyu Peng;  Yajiong Xue;  Xitong Guo;  Nengmin Wang,Employees’ Exploration of Complex Systems: An Integrative View, autonomy;  ERP;  innovation climate;  IS jobs;  system exploration;  task complexity;  task variety,"Based on the theory of effective use and adaptive structuration theory, we propose that employees’ system exploration behavior can be affected by factors related to three major components: task, system, and organizational environment. Specifically, we examine how task characteristics (job autonomy and task variety), system complexity, and innovation climate jointly affect employees’ exploration, which, in turn, leads to extended use of enterprise systems. A field survey of enterprise resource planning (ERP) users yields several interesting findings. First, job autonomy and task variety directly enhance system exploration. Second, system complexity plays a moderating role by strengthening the relationship between job autonomy and exploration and weakening the relationship between task variety and exploration. Third, innovation climate, also acting as a moderator, strengthens both the impact of job autonomy on exploration and the impact of system exploration on extended use. This research contributes to information systems (IS) research by theoretically articulating that system exploration is subject to the simultaneous influences of task, system, and organizational environment factors and empirically testing these factors’ main effects and interactions to shed new light on system exploration research. It also contributes to IS practice by suggesting that organizations could enhance employees’ system exploration and facilitate the transition from exploration to extended use by increasing job autonomy and task variety, designing personalized training programs to reduce system complexity, and developing organizational climates that foster innovations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,1,322,357
274, Eric K. Clemons;  Joshua S. Wilson,"Family Preferences Concerning Online Privacy, Data Mining, and Targeted Ads: Regulatory Implications", data mining;  educational software;  online behavior;  online teen behavior;  privacy;  privacy regulation,"Young Internet users engage in risky or inappropriate behavior online that could either be embarrassing or harmful to their future. As importantly, young Internet users engage in online activities that reveal a great deal about the cost to serve them and their willingness to pay for goods and services, which could be used against them by well-informed sellers. Educational applications that collect users’ information are becoming ubiquitous in the classroom, presenting the opportunity for students’ data to be mined. We are not aware of prior studies that examine parental or students’ attitudes and preferences toward data mining of educational application accounts, and how these attitudes differ across several countries. We used three survey instruments to measure parents’ and students’ attitudes toward data mining of educational applications. Parents in all countries studied prefer far less data mining of students’ online activities than seems to be the current practice. Most importantly, aversion to data mining does not seem to be correlated with awareness of current practices of data mining of teens’ activities. This study highlights regulatory alternatives and suggests future research and future data requirements for designing appropriate regulatory interventions. The nature of the intervention will be guided by the nature of the causes of inappropriate online behavior and inappropriate selection of educational software. Intervention could range from no regulation needed, through providing greater transparency, to new and detailed legal requirements that software providers must meet.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,40,70

We address the following research questions: What is the impact of IT investment on the return and risk dimensions of industry financial performance? How do industry characteristics moderate the relationship between IT investment and industry performance? Our analysis of these questions finds that higher levels of industry competition are associated with higher IT productivity (contribution of IT to value-added output), lower IT profitability (contribution of IT to industry average return on assets [ROA]), and higher IT risk (contribution of IT to ex ante variability of ROA). This is consistent with the notion that competition induces riskier IT investments, despite the fact that returns tend to be competed away. Higher levels of industry regulation are associated with lower IT returns in both productivity and profitability, but also lower IT risk. Finally, a higher rate of technological change induces both higher IT returns and higher IT risk. A variety of tests indicate that our results are robust. Our results shed light on factors that drive variation in IT performance across industries, and provide useful industry-level performance benchmarks of the return and risk impacts of IT investments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,71,103

Prior research often used a variance perspective and neglected to explore the complex interactions and timing dependencies between the critical success factors. This study adopts a process perspective to capture the dynamics while providing a new explanation for the mixed outcomes of SOA implementation. We develop a system dynamics model and use simulation analysis to demonstrate the phenomenon of “tipping point.” That is, under certain conditions, even a small reduction in the duration of normative commitment can dramatically reverse, from success to failure, the outcome of an SOA implementation. The simulation results also suggest that (1) the duration of normative commitment can play a more critical role than the strength, and (2) the minimal duration of normative commitment for a successful SOA implementation is associated positively with the information delay of organizational learning of SOA knowledge. Finally, we discuss the theoretical causes and organizational traps associated with SOA implementation to help IT managers make better decisions about their implementation projects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,104,133

We also study the boundary conditions of this relationship. The results of our empirical study indicate that receiving knowledge from other software developers in the company is positively related to the performance of the knowledge-receiving software developers. Moreover, this relationship was stronger when the software developers had high rather than low task autonomy, when they had high- rather than low-quality social exchanges with their supervisors, and when the software development firms used formal knowledge utilization processes. Theoretically, these results contribute to a better understanding of the processes through which software developers utilize the knowledge that they receive from their peers in the firm. Practically, they show software development firms how emphasizing the task, social, and institutional dimensions of the software development process can help them increase knowledge utilization and performance in software development.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,134,161

Despite their unique contextual characteristics, only a handful of Q&A websites have been successful in sustaining members’ active participation that, unlike lurking, consists of not only posting questions but also answering others’ inquiries. Because the specific design of the information technology artifacts on Q&A websites can influence their level of success, studying leading Q&A communities such as Yahoo! Answers (YA) provides insights into more effective design mechanisms. We tested a goal-oriented action framework using data from 2,920 YA users, and found that active online participation is largely driven by artifacts (e.g., incentives), membership (e.g., levels of membership and tenure), and habit (e.g., past behavior). This study contributes to the information systems literature by showing that active participation can be understood as the setting, pursuit, and automatic activation of goals.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,162,203

Our study is instantiated on a unique single-source dataset of 12-month home-scanned brand purchase records of a group of fast-moving consumer good brands and Facebook brand Fan Page messages related to the brands. We first find that exposures to earned and owned social media activities for brands have significant and positive impacts on consumers’ likelihood to purchase the brands. Their effects are, surprisingly, suppressive on each other. Second, exposures to earned and owned social media activities have almost no impact on the amount purchased offline with presence of in-store promotions. Our study contributes to our knowledge body of social media marketing by demonstrating that social media activities for a brand can foster the consumer base of the brand, but that effort is not necessarily sales-oriented. In addition, our study is conducive to guiding marketers onto the strategic allocation of advertising dollars to online social channels featuring a mixture of earned and owned social media.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,204,238

We test two competing models that build on direct causation theory and affect heuristic theory, respectively. In a direct effect model, affect steers self-disclosure, independent of cognitive cost–benefit appraisals. The indirect effect model instead suggests that affect influences self-disclosure by adjusting perceptions of benefits and costs. The empirical comparison of the models relies on survey data from more than 500 university students. Overall, affect influences self-disclosure indirectly by adjusting the benefits people perceive. In particular, affect toward self-disclosure and toward SN websites relate positively to self-disclosure motivators; their perceived values appear amplified in the presence of positive affect. We also offer a plausible, alternative explanation of the observed positive relationship between privacy risk and self-disclosure according to an indirect effect model, in which self-disclosure is driven mainly by motivators, whereas the effects of inhibitors depend a posteriori on self-disclosure. These findings call for a reconsideration of any exclusive focus on the direct impacts of affect on technology use, as is common in previous research, and suggest the importance of affective factors for understanding social technology uses and managing customer relationships.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,239,277
282, Xin Li;  Sherry X. Sun;  Kun Chen;  Terrance Fung;  Huaiqing Wang,Design Theory for Market Surveillance Systems, design theory;  market surveillance systems;  text mining;  financial markets;  efficient market hypothesis;  text understanding theory,"Market surveillance systems (MSSs) are information systems that monitor financial markets to combat market abuses. Existing MSSs focus mainly on analyzing trading activities and are often developed through a trial-and-error approach by screening data mining algorithms and features. The void of theoretical direction limits the effectiveness of MSSs and calls for the development of a design theory based on a thorough examination of the meta-requirements of MSSs. Based on the efficient market hypothesis and text understanding theory, this paper argues that market information analysis should be incorporated into MSSs and commonsense knowledge should be employed to connect related events to transactions and provide reference concepts for understanding market context and assessing transaction risk. We show the effectiveness of this proposed design theory through developing and evaluating a prototype system in the context of a real-world stock exchange market. By taking a theory-driven approach, this research shows the possibility and provides guidelines on the use of market information analysis to alleviate the market surveillance problem, which has significant implications for financial markets and the economy given the explosive growth of illegal trading activities worldwide.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,278,313

We apply the opportunity theory of crime, the institutional anomie theory, and institutional theory to identify factors that could increase or decrease the contextual risk of data breach. We investigate the risk of data breach in the context of an organization’s physical location, its primary industry, and the type of data breach that it may have suffered in the past. Given the location of an organization, the study finds support for application of the opportunity theory of crime and the institutional anomie theory in estimating the risk of data breach incidents within a state. In the context of the primary industry in which an organization operates, we find support for the institutional theory and the opportunity theory of crime in estimating risk of data breach incidents within an industry. Interestingly though, support for the opportunity theory of crime is partial. We find that investment in information technology (IT) security corresponds to a higher risk of data breach incidents within both a state and an industry, a result contrary to the one predicted by the opportunity theory of crime. A possible explanation for the contradiction is that investments in IT security are not being spent on the right kind of data security controls, a fact supported by evidence from the industry. The work has theoretical and practical implications. Theories from criminology are used to identify the risk factors of data breach incidents and the magnitude of their impact on the risk of data breach. Insights from the study can help IT security practitioners to assess the risk environment of their firm (in terms of data breaches) based on the firm’s location, its industry sector, and the kind of breaches that the firm may typically be prone to.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,314,341

In these contests, active and motivated individuals collaborate in the form of self-organized teams that compete for rewards. Using a rich data set of 732 teams in 52 contests collected from the crowdsourcing platform, Kaggle.com, from its launch in April 2010 to July 2012, we studied how the allocation of members’ social and intellectual capital within a virtual team affects team performance in online crowdsourcing contests. Our econometric analysis uses a rank-ordered logistic regression model, and suggests that the effect of a member’s social and intellectual capital on team performance varies depending on his or her roles. Though a team leader’s social capital and a team expert’s intellectual capital significantly influence team performance, a team leader’s intellectual capital and a team expert’s social capital do not. Further, we found that the alignment of a member’s social and intellectual capital within a team has a significant influence on team performance. Moreover, the intensity of the competition moderates the impact. When a contest is highly competitive, the social and intellectual capital alignment negatively affects team performance, and when the competitive intensity is low, this alignment positively affects team performance. Our findings provide insights into improving performance in team-based competitions in crowdsourcing communities.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,2,8,39

Derrick;  Gerhard Schwabe,The Last Research Mile: Achieving Both Rigor and Relevance in Information Systems Research, design science;  prototypes;  research methodology;  research rigor;  systems research,"From our desk chairs it may be tempting to work up an idea, build a quick prototype, test it in a lab, and say, “Our work here is done; the rest is merely details.” More scholarly knowledge awaits discovery, however, by researchers who shepherd an information systems (IS) solution through the last research mile, that is, through successful transition to the workplace. Going the last research mile means using scientific knowledge and methods to address important unsolved classes of problems for real people with real stakes in the outcomes. The last research mile proceeds in three stages: proof-of-concept research to demonstrate the functional feasibility of a solution; proof-of-value research to investigate whether a solution can create value across a variety of conditions; and proof-of-use research to address complex issues of operational feasibility. The last research mile ends only when practitioners routinely use a solution in the field. We argue that going the last research mile negates the assumption that one must trade off rigor and relevance, showing it to be it a false dilemma. Systems researchers who take their solutions through the last research mile may ultimately have the greatest impact on science and society. We demonstrate the last research mile with cases from our own work and the work of others spanning more than forty years.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,3,10,47

They represent an important but as yet understudied type of complex services that integrates many stakeholders acting in service value networks. These complex services typically comprise a combination of information technology (IT) services and highly person-oriented, non-IT services, and are characterized by long service delivery periods. In such an environment, it is particularly difficult to generate successful and sustainable business models, which are necessary for the widespread provision of telemedicine services. Following a design research approach, we develop and evaluate the CompBizMod framework, a morphological box allowing for: (1) the analysis, description, and classification of telemedicine business models, (2) the identification of white spots for future business opportunities, (3) and the identification of patterns for successful business models. We contribute to the literature by presenting a specific business model framework and identifying three business model patterns in the telemedicine industry.

290, Robert O. Briggs;  Jay F. Nunamaker;  Ralph H. Sprague,1001 Unanswered Research Questions in GSS,," Introduction to the Special Issue SINCE  1988  WE HAVE HEARD FROM COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS  at almost every MIS conference that group support systems (GSS) research is dead. We are taking the opportunity afforded by this special issue to argue that GSS research is much more like a fresh sapling than a tough and tired forest giant; GSS research is much closer to its beginning than to its end. In this introduction we commend ten fine papers to your attention, then we offer you a challenge: more than 250 unanswered GSS research questions. We know that with just a nudge, you, the readers, will think of many more GSS research questions than we suggest here. We are confident that a proverbial 1001 GSS research streams remain to be explored. We hope you will find the GSS research papers presented in this special issue engaging, and the research questions provocative. We are pleased to present the best GSS research papers from the Thirtieth Annual Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science. Four of the papers were finalists in the Best Paper competition, and one was selected as the Best Paper. Research methods range from rigorous empiricism to action research to meta-analysis. As with so much of MIS research, the papers in this issue range from very behavioral to very technical, but they all contain elements of both. The focus of the first four papers is strongly behavioral. Kelly and Bostrom, in ""A Facilitator's General Model for Managing Socio-Emotional Issues in Group Support Systems Meeting Environments,"" delve into the affective components of facilitating teamwork with GSS. They present a model for perceiving and managing these issues based on structured interviews with twenty-six experienced facilitators. Whether in the electronic boardroom or the electronic classroom, flaming is flaming. In ""Flaming in the Electronic Classroom,""Reinig, Briggs, and Nunamaker develop a causal model for flaming in GSS sessions. They test the model with a laboratory experiment and then report on five case studies where teachers in the field used the model to create interventions that eliminated flaming from anonymous electronic interactions among students. In ""Information Exchange and Use in GSS and Verbal Group Decision Making: Effects of Minority Influence,""Dennis, Hilmer, and Taylor delve into the difficult terrain of decision making. This paper represents an important trend in GSS research toward studying ideation within the broader context of group processes. The authors found that, when there was a majority/minority split, groups using a particular combination of GSS technology and techniques exchanged more information and made better decisions than did groups with no technology. When there was no opinion split, the same technology/technique combination led to more information exchange, but poorer decisions, which, as is so often the case, opens a whole new set of research questions. Pinsonneault and Heppel offer an interesting theoretical argument about the effects of anonymity on GSS interactions in ""Anonymity in Group Support Systems Research: A New Conceptualization, Measure, and Contingency Framework.""They argue that social evaluation is an important causal construct in the effects produced by anonymity. They also offer a preliminary instrument for measuring variables related to social evaluation. As this issue went to press, one of the reviewers for this paper collected data using the scales presented here. As the authors caution in their paper, the reviewer's statistical analysis suggested that the scales might require further refinement to improve their reliability, so one cannot take it as given that the instrument has been thoroughly validated. Nonetheless, the theoretical development is innovative and the results of the study are thought provoking. The paper will serve as a launching pad for more sophisticated research on anonymity in GSS. The next two papers address both behavioral and technical issues. Manzoni and Angehrn's ""Understanding Organizational Dynamics of IT-Enabled Change: A Multimedia Simulation Approach""addresses the use of an animated simulation for training IT managers to overcome resistance to change. The simulation embodies virtual people with distinct personalities and hidden agendas. This work points the way toward broader use of organizational games as pedagogical tools to provide managers with realistic experiential learning environments. In ""Collaborative Business Engineering with Animated Electronic Meetings,""de Vreede breaks new ground in an action research study with the Amsterdam Municipal Police. He combines static and dynamic process models with GSS to support teams evaluating current and future work practices. He develops new concepts of operation for GSS and for simulation in support of organizational change. The three papers that follow have a strong technical flavor, but, as always in MIS, the work has behavioral and organizational implications as well. Software is becoming more and more integrated into our lives. It is embedded in everything from airplane parts to dishwashers. Van Genuchten, in his award-winning paper, ""Supporting Inspections with an Electronic Meeting System,""addresses the use of GSS to support Fagan inspections for structured reviews of systems development documents intended to identify and log defects as early in a project as possible. He reports on fourteen field cases and concludes that the use of GSS can substantially improve the inspection process, revealing more defects more quickly than would otherwise be possible. For the past thirty years MIS has faced the same set of problems: poor estimates, cost overruns, and systems that do not meet the needs of the users. The holy grail of MIS research has long been finding a way to allow the users to define their requirements for a new information system, and then to have tools automatically generate first logical and physical designs, and then the code. Getting the users involved has been an elusive goal. In ""The Involvement of Multiple Users: Methods and Tools or Software Engineering,""Dean, Lee, Pendergast, Hickey, and Nunamaker report on a research stream that has made a substantial step toward that goal. They report on the development of GSS tools specifically for capturing system requirements from users, and they report on the results of several field studies where these tools were used. In the most technical of the papers in this special issue, Bui, Bodart, and Ma propose a formal language to support and document argumentation, claims, decision and negotiation, and coordination in network-based organizations. The paper, ""ARBAS: A Formal Language to Support Argumentation in Network-Based Organizations,""proposes that the language be used over the Internet to create a corporate memory of otherwise ephemeral interactions. The work in this paper harks back to and builds upon the foundation of the work of Bodart and others on Problem Statement Language/Problem Statement Analyzer (PSL/PSA). Despite its highly technical orientation, the paper also has social, legal, and behavioral implications. Finally, in an unprecedented move, we are holding what would have been the tenth paper in this issue over to become the anchor of next year's special issue. Fjermestad and Hiltz have spent several years preparing an exhaustive analysis of all GSS laboratory research that has ever been published. This paper offers a categorical framework for organizing GSS research and examines the studies in terms of methods, independent variables, dependent variables, and results. Because of the completeness of its coverage, this paper will serve as an important foundation and as a launching pad for much GSS research for many years to come. The paper is necessarily quite long, and given the choice of losing some of its value by shortening it or holding it over to present it in its entirety, we opted for the latter. We are pleased the authors have chosen this forum for their work, and we look forward to its debut next year. GSS Research A T THE CLOSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, A LEARNED PHYSICIST  asserted that his discipline was nearly complete. Other than a few loose ends, nothing else remained to be learned. Of course, the loose ends turned out to be the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and nuclear physics, among others. In 1943, Thomas J. Watson, Sr., chairman of IBM, said, ""I think there is a world market for maybe five computers .""As the twenty-first century approaches, the assertion has begun to circulate among IS academics that group support systems (GSS) research is dead, that other than a few loose ends, nothing remains to be learned. For more than a decade researchers have been developing and testing group support systems [14, 17, 20, 32, 33, 58]. GSS are suites of tools designed to focus the deliberation and enhance the communication of teams working under high cognitive loads. Research from both the field and the laboratory has shown that teams using GSS can become far more productive than would otherwise be possible [11, 14, 17, 22, 30, 32, 33, 36, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 53, 55]. Independent case studies across several organizations around the world have demonstrated that teams using GSS have reduced their labor costs by as much as 50 percent and have reduced the number of calendar days in their projects up to 90 percent [12, 16, 22, 38, 43]. Although GSS is not yet widely deployed, it has already been used by several million people. It has developed beyond the academic sandbox to become a key resource in more than 1,500 organizations, many of which report millions of dollars of cost savings and cost avoidance from its use [43, 54]. More than 140 GSS experiments have already been reported in the GSS literature [17], as have dozens of field studies [11]. With what has been done, is there really anything else important to study about GSS? Most emphatically, yes. There are still many more questions than answers in GSS research. Existing studies have touched only the edges of the vast technology-for-teams territory. We hope herein to illuminate some of the rich GSS research opportunities that must yet be taken. What Is a GSS? A  GROUP SUPPORT SYSTEM EASES THE COGNITIVE LOAD OF TEAMS  working in concert toward a mutual goal. Sometimes team members ""all talk at once""by typing their ideas simultaneously into a network of computer workstations. The system immediately makes all these contributions available to other members of the team who can read them on their individual screens. This allows the entire team to hear from every member in about the same time it would normally take to hear from only one [32, 37]. At other times, teams use a GSS to cooperate while separated by space and time. Sometimes teams use GSS anonymously to raise and explore new and perhaps unpopular or politically risky ideas that a member might otherwise be reluctant to voice for fear of reprisal from peers or superiors. The anonymity allows participants to evaluate an idea based on its merits rather than on its source. Other teams find it useful to make fully identified contributions, so team members can assess the expertise of the contributor, or so they can hold one another accountable for action items. A group support system is a suite of software tools, each of which focuses team efforts in some unique way [37]. A brainstorming tool, for example, encourages a team to diverge from its customary thinking patterns, to go farther afield to find as many new ideas as possible in a brief time. In contrast, other tools encourage a group to converge quickly on a set of key issues, or to explore a defined set of issues in great depth and detail. A GSS tool kit may also include tools to support team writing, polling for consensus, evaluation of alternatives, and other activities for working together toward a goal, whether a team is working at the same time in the same place or is separated across many time zones and working asynchronously [37]. GSS Research Questions T HIS PAPER PRESENTS A SERIES OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS ORGANIZED  under major headings. The list of questions in each heading is by no means exhaustive; indeed, even the set of headings is not exhaustive. However, this set of questions may be sufficient to persuade the reader that GSS will remain a rich field for academic endeavor for some time to come. Ideation Issues Much of the early GSS research focused on improving ideation processes. Every aspect of problem solving requires ideation. People produce more ideas with GSS than without GSS [19, 24, 26, 53]. People working with a critical evaluative tone produced more ideas than people with an affirmative evaluative tone [10]. People who broke the problem down to subproblems generated more ideas than people who worked with a problem as a whole. People with a basis for social comparison produced more than people with no such basis [49]. These interesting and useful findings have been the basis for many successful GSS interactions. However, many questions about GSS ideation remain unanswered. For example, it might be useful to know the distribution of good ideas over time so the team can make informed choices about how long to spend on ideation. When do the best ideas come? Early? Late? Evenly spaced throughout? Why? What might it cost a group in terms of good ideas if they cut ideation short? What if they stress the participants, insisting on rapid ideation without reflection? Field and lab experience suggests that the facilitation method used with the GSS has a strong effect on ideation [1, 9, 15, 18, 29, 52, 58], but to date only three or four ideation techniques have been rigorously examined. What other facilitation techniques might improve ideation? Do differences in leadership approach result in differing distributions of good ideas over time? Are those differences important to group productivity? There are a variety of electronic tools to support ideation [37]. Some start each participant on a different electronic page, while others start participants on the same electronic page. What interfaces are best for supporting electronic ideation processes under what conditions? When is a group outline more effective for ideation than a shared flat list? How does the tradeoff between quality and quantity play out during ideation with a GSS? Do silly ideas inspire good ideas? At what point does the volume of bad ideas overwhelm the cognitive resources of the participants? Convergence Issues People produce many ideas with electronic brainstorming tools, some good, some bad. A great deal of research has been published about ideation, but almost nothing has been written about helping a group converge on the best ideas among all those generated. Convergence can be a slow, painful process [8]. Is there an optimal process for converging on the best ideas? How does a group decide what constitutes a good idea? What processes might help a group converge on the best ideas more effectively? What leadership techniques might ease the pain of convergence? When is chauffeured list building more effective than simultaneous team list building? How might artificial intelligence aid the ideation process? In recent years researchers have begun to investigate supporting geographically separated and asynchronous team work [23, 34, 35, 46, 47, 51, 52]. They report that convergence is much more difficult with distributed teams than with face-to-face teams. Why is this so? What can be done to improve matters? Questions about Deliberation Idea generation and convergence are critical in all aspects of teamwork. However, there is much more to teamwork than just idea generation [4, 37, 44]. Consider the problem-solving process: sense making, alternative generation, alternative evaluation, choice making, implementation planning, results monitoring. Each of these steps is critically important, and yet very little is yet known about the use of GSS to support each of these phases. Do people who use electronic brainstorming tools explore the problem space more completely? Under what conditions do they converge on an optimal understanding of the problem? Under what conditions do they select poor explanations of their problem? What leadership or facilitation techniques lead to optimal exploration of problem space? Is there a single optimal approach to such exploration, or does it vary by task? Group? Technology? Which alternative evaluation techniques are effective? Does that vary with the task at hand? Under what circumstances do people using GSS make better choices than people working without GSS? Which GSS tools and techniques improve choice making and which hurt it? Does it depend on the technology at hand? The team? If so, how? Why? What combination of technology and technique will produce the most effective plans? How can GSS be used to break an impasse? How can GSS be used to move teams toward consensus? What can be done with GSS to move plans forward? To track progress? To hold team members responsible for one another? This deliberation process has emerged out of millennia of human experience, but that experience was unsupported by electronic technology. Is that process still optimal? Are there ways of short-circuiting the process with technology? Questions of GSS and Information Access One important function of a GSS is to give the group ready access to information--information stored on-line and information stored in the minds of the group members--but only a few groundbreaking pieces of research have examined information access in the GSS environment. Information has value to the degree that it is timely, accurate, and complete. However, its value is offset by the cognitive costs of searching for, assimilating, and remembering the information. Does GSS give a team access to more information more quickly? More accurately? More completely? At what cognitive cost? Can GSS be used to reduce the cost of finding information? Assimilating it? Retrieving it? One function of information is to increase the probability that an actor will expect the outcome the actor actually obtains when choosing one course of action over another. Do teams using GSS expect their outcomes more frequently than teams who do not use GSS? Does that depend on the task? The team? The technology? Another function of information is to increase the actor's awareness that possibilities exist. Do people using GSS consider more alternatives than others? Are they more effective at selecting among them? Why or why not? Helmut Krcmar of Hohenheim University in Germany defines information as ""A model of something, for some purpose.""The same information can be modeled in many different ways. Can GSS be used to present models that are more easily assimilated? Can it be used to produce such models? Do people using GSS seek different kinds of information than people who do not? What is the effect of that difference? Do people who use GSS purpose different things than people who do not? Is that good? Always? Why? GSS and Communication Issues One of the benefits GSS brings to a group is the ability to communicate in parallel, which may allow people to share information and expertise more quickly [37]. Is that sharing as complete with GSS as it with other media? Under what circumstances do people choose to attend to the contributions of others? Under what circumstances do they ignore one another's work? Does this change over time? Does it change over tasks? Are there processes for increasing the degree to which people attend to one another's ideas? When is this a desirable outcome? Are there advantages to serial communication that are lost during parallel communication? What are the political implications of a channel where nobody can shout down an opponent? Do people express the same ideas on a keyboard that they would express orally? Are there new and better means of expression than those that now exist? Does a message carry more weight if it appears on a screen than when it enters the ears? If so, under what circumstances might that difference be desirable? Undesirable? Questions about GSS and Goal Congruence In order to be productive, a team may use a GSS to reduce the cognitive loads associated with communication, deliberation, and information access. However, no technology can improve the productivity of people who choose to be unproductive [4]. People hold many, sometimes mutually exclusive, personal goals: To survive and thrive, to be accepted and loved, to look good, to hold a job, to get ahead--the list is endless. Teams accept many tasks. People will only make an effort to achieve the team goal to the extent that the team goal is compatible with whatever private goals are salient to the individuals on the team. How can a GSS be used to establish and maintain goal congruence? Can it be used to reveal hidden agendas? Is that desirable? Always? Can it be used to change the salience of personal goals? Anonymity is a goal-congruence issue that has received some attention in the GSS literature. A great deal of work has been done to examine the effects of anonymity on idea generation [10, 24, 25, 26, 27, 48, 56]. Teams produce more ideas when working anonymously than when identified. There is some thinking that this is the combined result of two goal-congruence effects. Researchers have posited that people may be reluctant to propose ideas that might garner negative reactions from peers or superiors. Allowing them to work anonymously may overcome this reluctance. While many papers have offered this explanation, no study has yet tested it. Will the evaluation-apprehension model stand up to rigorous scrutiny? Social loafing research suggests that people generating ideas anonymously do not expend as much effort when working anonymously as they do when working identified [41, 48]. This may also be a goal-congruence issue. Do people make more effort when identified to avoid social sanctions? Do they value credit for their work more than they value the output of their effort? Why? How can GSS be built or used differently to overcome social loafing without sacrificing the other benefits of anonymity? Other than increased ideation, what benefits are there to anonymity? What are the costs? Which team processes are helped by anonymity? Which are not? Organizational Implications of GSS New technologies often change the way entire industries do business. The business processes were often not even imaginable before the advent of the technology. For instance, American Hospital Supply placed computer terminals at their customers' sites and revolutionized their industry. Before the advent of computerized transactions, a bank could only be open to the public a few hours of the day. With ATM cards, we now do much of our banking in the parking lot, and some if it at the grocery store. What new organizational forms are now possible with GSS? What new organizational forms might be desirable? What impact will those new forms have on organizational structure and power distributions? One of the key changes we have observed in the field is that many managers and knowledge workers use GSS to support meetings where they actually do work rather than just planning to do work [32, 35]. What effect might this change have on the productivity of a team? An organization? Are organizations doing more work with fewer people because of GSS? Unanswered Questions about Process Gains and Losses In 1991, we noted that GSS might offer certain process gains to a team, and that these gains were, to some extent, offset by process losses. Table 1 lists some of those gains and losses. To date, few of these gains and losses have been explored in detail. Most have been subjected to no rigorous academic investigation. To what extent are these factors important to the outcomes of a GSS meeting? To what extent do they interact? To what extent are they cumulative, or mutually exclusive? Questions of Ethics Teams may use GSS to make choices about the use of scarce resources, and these choices may have permanent consequences for the participants and for non-participants. What ethical issues must be considered in the use of GSS? When important decisions are made by groups of unidentifiable individuals, who is accountable? Who should be rewarded? Who should be blamed? Are these issues different because the GSS is being used, or are they the same issues that already arise in standard human interactions? The transcripts of electronic meetings are more permanent than spoken words. Who owns these transcripts? The participants? All the participants? The organizations for whom they work? Who has the right to destroy the transcripts? Under what conditions may the transcripts be made public? Under what circumstances should an organization be held liable for an anonymous contribution to a GSS session? Team Telework Issues The emergence of the global marketplace may drive the development of GSS over the next decade. More and more geographically distributed teams are using GSS and other collaborative technology to facilitate team telework [46, 47]. While the demand for team telework grows, little is known about how to actually conduct team telework. How can leaders move a group through a process? How can technology replace the rich nonverbal cues of face-to-face work? What cues should be replaced? Should they be directly replaced, or are there technological surrogates that differ substantially from the original cues? What must be done to create a sense of presence among people who are geographically separated? Is a sense of presence necessary? Is it desirable? Are there tasks that are best done face to face? Are there tasks that are best done distributed? Which are they? Why? What can be done to motivate the efforts of geographically distributed team members? What can be done to monitor their motivation? Do the same features and functions that support face-to-face groups support geographically separated groups just as well? What new features and functions might be required? Why? How must GSS be designed or used differently to support synchronous distributed work than for asynchronous work? What changes in GSS technology and group process will be required to support collaboration for teams distributed along the dimensions of time, space, and computing resources? What are the requirements for a distributed group support system that extend beyond those used in face-to-face systems, in terms of data content, interface presentation, and tool and resource features? How do the roles of facilitators, team leaders, and participants in distributed settings change from those in face-to-face settings? Cultural and Cross-Cultural Issues The vast majority of GSS research has focused on GSS usage in American and European corporate culture. What would GSS look like if designed specifically for use in Europe, Asia, or Australia? Will Japanese teams require different GSS support than German teams? How about teams with members from both Japan and Germany? Much of the work on cross-cultural teams is bilateral, dealing with how members of one culture can adapt to better interact with members of another culture. Can GSS provide a new common ground for interaction among several cultures? What if group members do not share a common language? What if group members do not share a common set of culturally based group norms? When does an international video conference make more sense than a trip around the world? When doesn't it? How does the role of the facilitator change from one culture to the next? What affect does culture have on the adoption of GSS? What affect does culture have on satisfaction with GSS technologies? Can GSS be used to maintain a sense of togetherness among distributed multicultural employees of a multination corporation? Given that over 140 GSS experimental studies have been published, how many of these findings can be generalized to Asian, South American, Australian, African, or European cultures? What is the role of GSS in the global village? Group Negotiation Questions Recently, a probation officer suggested that GSS could be used to facilitate communication between members of opposing gangs. He suggested that the anonymity would allow the rival members to speak to each other not as a gang representative but as an individual that may allow them to find a common ground from which to resolve their differences. Do GSS have a role in this type of meeting environment? What is the potential for this type of application? What would a GSS look like if it were designed for gang leaders instead of corporate leaders? What other types of group therapy might have members who are reluctant to express themselves and could potentially benefit from GSS? GSS and Business Process Reengineering Recently, advances have been made in the development of specific GSS tools to support the process of business reengineering such as the Enterprise Analyzer. How effective are these tools? What is the role of GSS in reengineering? To what extent can GSS be integrated with other reengineering software such as CASE tools? Leadership and Process Structure Issues Research has shown that even with a single GSS tool, a single, subtle difference in leadership method can lead to massive differences in group dynamics and productivity [48]. What other leadership methods might lead to similar differences? Under what conditions do teams perform better under a leader who uses GSS to structure and focus group processes? Under what conditions do groups perform better when they use the GSS with no leader and no structure? How can leaders use GSS to uncover hidden agendas among group members? Is uncovering hidden agendas necessarily a good thing? Why or why not? What effect does it have on group process for the group to surface hidden agendas? Adoption and Diffusion of GSS What causes an organization to adopt GSS? Research shows that teams using GSS save 50 percent to 70 percent of their labor costs and reduce their project cycle times by 90 percent. However, technology cannot benefit those who choose not to use it. Despite the massive successes of GSS in many organizations, the technology is diffusing slowly. Given the payoffs, why isn't GSS technology spreading like wildfire? Are the organizational changes surrounding the introduction of GSS too painful? Are the GSS tools too awkward or technically complex for most people to use? Are there affective issues that hinder diffusion? Social issues? Is it simply a lack of information or understanding that keeps people from using the technology? For GSS to be an organizational success, one must plan for and overcome resistance to change. In The Prince  (written around 1500), Machiavelli made an insightful observation about change that may be relevant to GSS research: ""There is nothing more difficult to handle, more doubtful of success, and more dangerous to carry through than initiating changes to the state's constitution. The innovator makes enemies of all those who have prospered under the old order, and only lukewarm support is forthcoming from those who would prosper under the new."" Thomas Edison saw the difficulty of change as well: ""The Inventor can't do it all. You've got to change people. We have an enormous capacity to invent super-machinery. But our desire to install the device is weak. Human inertia is the problem, not invention. Something in man makes him resist change."" [February 1923] Does the technology violate powerful political interests within organizations? Or is it simply that, all things being equal, people resist change? In either case, what change management processes will work? What incentive and social structures could be created to ease the transition? What payoffs would be sufficient to offset the cost of change? How can we measure the benefits and costs of GSS? Some speculate that the champions of GSS within an organization gain high visibility and receive rapid promotions away from the GSS-related job. This strands the technology without a champion, making the diffusion process self-extinguishing. Is the process really self-extinguishing? If so, what can be done? GSS and Electronic Commerce GSS tools are now available on the World Wide Web, allowing people from different organizations to join a collaborative problem-solving session with minimal effort. What role might GSS take in supporting interorganizational cooperation? What role might it play in fostering electronic commerce? For example, a major management trend is the development of ""virtual corporations""--sets of separate organizational entities tightly linked by strategic alliances. Can GSS be instrumental in defining, nurturing, and monitoring the relationships on which these alliances are based? How are GSS best structured and used for these purposes? Intranets promise to redefine traditional corporate computing. GSS may become part of an integrated I/S architecture, with one common interface, instead of a separate application. How would that architecture be structured? What relative roles would be played by GSS? Collaborative Modeling and Simulation Often people use GSS to collect and collate information about the parameters of their problem space or their solution space. Recent pilot efforts have demonstrated the technical feasibility of rolling team-generated parameters into models and simulations to support design and decision-making activities. What processes are suitable to optimize team parameterization of models? How do teams perceive the information in the models? Are team-generated simulations more accurate or more complete than individually generated simulations? Can teams build simulations more quickly than individuals? Do teams make better choices when supported by team simulations? Under what circumstances? GSS Software and Network Architectures GSS software has evolved through four architectures: Mainframe, DOS/flat-file/LAN, Windows/Database/LAN, and now WEB-based client-server [46, 47]. To date, no rigorous academic investigations of GSS software architecture have been conducted. How can one optimize the software architecture to assure rapid interface response for users, while accommodating low-speed and intermittent data communication channels? Is client-server the optimal software architecture for collaborative technology? Why or why not? Should a client be thick, with most of the processing done at the client end, or thin, with most of the processing done at the server? What are the tradeoffs for making this choice? Where should the data reside? Locally? Remotely? Both? Should the system push data or poll for it? How should the architecture of the GSS accommodate other applications? How could the architecture be designed to support rapid prototyping of new tools? GSS for Crisis Response When responding to a crisis, a leader must quickly bring the right people together--those with the right information, expertise, and leadership ability. These people must continuously develop and evaluate possible courses of action in response to the unfolding situation. Cognitive processes for people working under time pressure are substantially different than for people working at a more deliberate pace. Do current GSS tools provide adequate support for crisis response? What new tools might be required? What new processes might be required for teams in crisis? People under time pressure are far better at comparative decision making than at judgment. Do current GSS tools and techniques take best advantage of this situation? Individuals working under time pressure are better at naturalistic decision making than at rational decision making. In naturalistic decision making, an expert perceives key cues, matches them with internal patterns, performs an immediate diagnosis, and recommends a single solution. With rationalistic decision making, the decision maker generates and evaluates alternatives, then selects a course of action. However, some problems are large enough that no single decision maker has all the expertise or information or resources to solve the problem alone, and so decisions must be made by groups. Can GSS be used to move groups closer to the naturalistic model of decision making? Is that desirable? Will that effort require new GSS tools? Techniques? Virtual Workspace Issues A great deal of research has been published about teams using GSS in the same place at the same time. Recent field investigations suggest that people using GSS to support distributed collaboration have difficulty maintaining a sense of the group and its processes [46, 47]. It may be that the use of Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces [49, 50, 57] for GSS could alleviate many of these difficulties. The VR could provide an avatar that represented each member of the group and provided clues to what the group members were doing. What information should a group VR environment provide? What features and functions should it supply? Should the space be represented realistically--with gravity, walls, floors, desks, light switches, wall-sized screens? Should the virtual space be represented in ways that have nothing to do with physical space--no gravity, floating objects, embedded data? Why or why not? How should the team navigate through the space? Should avatars be able to pass through one another? Should they be able to establish private communication channels for their principals? Team Interface Design While it is clear that subtle differences in interface can cause major differences in group dynamics [48], little systematic research into GSS interface design has been done [21]. Shepherd, Briggs, Reinig, Yen, and Nunamaker [48] showed that a single horizontal line on one GSS interface led to an increase of 23 percent in ideation productivity. When combined with a new facilitation technique, productivity increased 63 percent. What other subtle differences in interface design might lead to similar or even larger improvements? How are team interfaces different than individual interfaces? What hidden costs might be associated with these increases in productivity? How much more productivity might be possible? Shared Drawing Questions With a few notable exceptions, most GSS technology is text-based, yet we observe that people often sketch and draw when they are working face to face. Developers have begun implementing shared whiteboards and shared graphics tools. Under what conditions are these tools more useful than text-based tools? There is little descriptive or prescriptive information available specifically about sketching. Will computer-based tools encourage more drawing? Will this make a difference for a group? What theoretical basis could best govern the development and use of shared drawing tools? Communication theory? Esthetics theory? Productivity theory? All three? Something else? For what kinds of tasks will shared drawing be useful? Useless? Why? Must shared drawing tools be different for representational drawing and conceptual drawing? How important is response time for clear communication? Should drawing capability be included in text tools? Should one be able to mark up text with drawings? Why? Are people more efficient at creating drawn artifacts with electronic tools or manual tools? Under what conditions would that matter? How might a group take advantage of the ability of an electronic tool to time-scroll, which is to undraw and redraw an image? Under what conditions do shared drawing tools make a team more effective? Cohesive? Satisfied? When might a team prefer a symbol-and-arrow tool to shared whiteboard, and vice versa? Should there be a single shared cursor? A cursor for each participant? No cursor? Should WYSIWIS be enforced? Optional? Ignored? Why? What new team processes might become possible that were not even contemplated before the advent of shared drawing tools? GSS in the Classroom A growing community of researchers is beginning to explore the use of GSS to support learning [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 28, 45, 55, 56]. In the past three years, the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science has published dozens of papers on the topic. Experience suggests that cooperative learning can be substantially enhanced through the judicious use of GSS. They are also finding that successful use of GSS requires a fundamental shift in the thinking paradigm of the instructor. Experience shows that standard classroom instruction and standard in-service training have been ineffective for conveying that paradigm shift. The presence of a researcher in the room for a year has been an effective but very inefficient method of inducing the change. Is there a shorter, less expensive way to achieve the change? What can be done to cause a paradigm shift among teachers? Will GSS have to become more simple to use? Will instruction have to become more rigorous? The military uses boot camp to instill new values in recruits. Will a boot camp approach work with teachers? What other innovative approaches might apply? What course materials might enhance the use of GSS in the classroom? Who should create those materials? Teachers? Vendors? The learners themselves? Research on GSS-for-learning has focused on engaging the learners in solving real problems. Are there other approaches that might be effective? How do we measure whether the GSS interventions are actually increasing learning? Conclusion A T THIS POINT WE MUST LEAVE OUR RECITATION OF  GSS research questions, not for lack of issues but for lack of space. We hope we have broadened your perspective on GSS. Since 1988 it has been a yearly event at ICIS, and more recently at AIS, to pronounce the demise of GSS research. Yet in this one paper we have identified the potential for at least 250 more doctoral dissertations. Each dissertation would make a substantial contribution to our understanding of GSS, and each would be likely to uncover deeper and more interesting questions than those posed here. Rhetorically speaking, there are 1001 questions yet to be answered. GSS research is like a cathedral whose foundations have been laid and whose supporting pillars are under construction. Still to come are the high stone walls, the vaulted ceilings, and the tracery stained glass windows. No single craftsperson can build a cathedral. Many craftspeople over several generations complete the wonder. So it is with GSS research.

Steininger;  Thomas Hess,It Is Not Just About Competition with “Free”: Differences Between Content Formats in Consumer Preferences and Willingness to Pay, conjoint analysis;  consumer preferences;  content formats;  digital device ownership;  digital media;  media industries;  willingness to pay,"While consumption of content in offline formats continues to decline, many providers are still struggling to monetize their content online, because consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for content in online formats is low. The availability of free content on the Internet is often considered the primary reason for this issue. However, we hold that the lower WTP is also related to a lower appraisal of online formats per se. Using a conjoint analysis and the example of newspaper subscriptions, we explore differences in consumer preferences and WTP between offline and online formats. Our results show that after price, format is the second-most important attribute of a newspaper subscription. While consumers still prefer the printed newspaper to any online format, WTP differs across online formats and is strongly associated with device ownership. Our study provides a novel understanding of the previously neglected factor content format and its importance for content providers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,3,105,128

Trends like globalization and increased product and service complexity have pushed organizations to become more and more reliant on collaboration in distributed, cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural, virtual teams. The present research is based on an applied science/engineering (AS/E) research paradigm to address an important class of unsolved problems—measuring the quality of collaboration within and across organizational boundaries. This paper presents a collaboration maturity model (Col-MM) to assess an organization’s team collaboration maturity as a first step toward a generalizable solution to that class of problems. The Col-MM is intended to be sufficiently generic to be applied to different organizational and team settings and usable by practitioners for conducting self-assessments. The Col-MM was developed during a series of focus group meetings with professionals (business unit managers). The model was then piloted and subsequently applied in a field study in an automotive company. This paper reports on the development and field application of the Col-MM. It contributes to the collaboration science literature, theory, and practice through a detailed AS/E study that develops a maturity model and a system for administering it that provides proof of value and effective use in the field.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,3,129,157

Drawing on the notion of virtue ethics propounded by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, we theorize that core organizational IT affordances influence the development of organizational virtues, which in turn influence organizational improvisational capabilities and innovation. We propose the “IT-virtues-innovation” (IVI) model and test it using a cross-organizational survey of 250 employees from various organizations in the United States. Our findings largely support our proposal that IT affordances positively influence organizational virtues, which then influence organizational improvisational capabilities, thus improving organizational innovation. This paper contributes to the understanding of organizational innovation by articulating the strategic usefulness of IT-enabled organizational ethics, and it explains how IT-enabled ethical competence (virtues) influences strategic competence (improvisational capabilities and innovation).",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,3,158,196

However, little is known about the effects of more negative personal characteristics that might result in more competitive, antisocial, and even unethical behavior. This paper considers Machiavellianism as one of the traits that constitute the “dark triad of personality” and explores the relationship between Machiavellianism and participants’ contribution behavior in online innovation contests. Specifically we investigate how Machiavellian characteristics influence individuals’ contribution intensity, communication, and interaction behavior within the contest community as well as the quality and kind of their contributions. This study relies on multisource individual-level data from a large innovation contest in the field of public transportation. We find that the three dimensions of Machiavellianism—distrust of others, amorality, and desire for status—have very distinct behavioral consequences in the context of online innovation contests. Specifically, the oppositional consequences of amoral manipulation and striving for status on the one hand and showing distrust of others on the other hand concerning contribution quantity and contribution quality are found. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of negative personality traits such as Machiavellianism as powerful predictors of behavior and of success within competitive innovation environments and leads to important managerial implications regarding the design and management of innovation contests.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,3,197,228
295, Nicolas Prat;  Isabelle Comyn-Wattiau;  Jacky Akoka,A Taxonomy of Evaluation Methods for Information Systems Artifacts, artifact evaluation;  content analysis;  design evaluation;  design science;  system design;  taxonomy,"Artifacts, such as software systems, pervade organizations and society. In the field of information systems (IS) they form the core of research. The evaluation of IS artifacts thus represents a major issue. Although IS research paradigms are increasingly intertwined, building and evaluating artifacts has traditionally been the purview of design science research (DSR). DSR in IS has not reached maturity yet. This is particularly true of artifact evaluation. This paper investigates the “what” and the “how” of IS artifact evaluation: what are the objects and criteria of evaluation, the methods for evaluating the criteria, and the relationships between the “what” and the “how” of evaluation? To answer these questions, we develop a taxonomy of evaluation methods for IS artifacts. With this taxonomy, we analyze IS artifact evaluation practice, as reflected by ten years of DSR publications in the basket of journals of the Association for Information Systems (AIS). This research brings to light important relationships between the dimensions of IS artifact evaluation, and identifies seven typical evaluation patterns: demonstration; simulation- and metric-based benchmarking of artifacts; practice-based evaluation of effectiveness; simulation- and metric-based absolute evaluation of artifacts; practice-based evaluation of usefulness or ease of use; laboratory, student-based evaluation of usefulness; and algorithmic complexity analysis. This study also reveals a focus of artifact evaluation practice on a few criteria. Beyond immediate usefulness, IS researchers are urged to investigate ways of evaluating the long-term organizational impact and the societal impact of artifacts.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,3,229,267
296, Michael Sacks,Competition Between Open Source and Proprietary Software: Strategies for Survival, differentiation;  endogenous fixed costs;  heterogeneous consumers;  Hotelling competition;  mixed duopoly;  open source software;  proprietary software,"There are two puzzles in the software competition literature: whether both proprietary and open source software will survive and how producers of proprietary software differentiate themselves from open source competition. I address both puzzles by analyzing competition between a firm producing proprietary software and a community producing open source software. If the firm faces no competition, then the software caters to less technologically savvy individuals. When facing competition, the open source software caters to the most technologically savvy individuals, leading the firm to target even less savvy individuals than it would when acting as a monopolist in order to differentiate its software from the open source option. The open source movement, then, may not be an unalloyed success as the growth in open source can be tied to deterioration in the proprietary software. Given that both types of software survive by catering to different segments of the market, an important avenue for research will be to analyze the stability of the underlying segments and the corresponding welfare implications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,3,268,295

Our study addresses two essential research questions: (1) How does organizational BDA usage affect value creation? and (2) What are key antecedents of organizational-level BDA usage? We draw on dynamic capabilities theory to conceptualize BDA use as a unique information processing capability that brings competitive advantage to organizations. Furthermore, we employ the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework to identify and theorize paths via which factors influence the actual usage of BDA. Survey data collected from 161 U.S.-based companies show that: organizational-level BDA usage affects organizational value creation; the degree to which BDA usage influences such creation is moderated by environmental dynamism; technological factors directly influence organizational BDA usage; and organizational and environmental factors indirectly influence organizational BDA usage through top management support. Collectively, these findings provide a theory-based understanding of the impacts and antecedents of organizational BDA usage, while also providing guidance regarding what managers should expect from usage of this rapidly emerging technology.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,4,39
299, Amrit Tiwana,Platform Desertion by App Developers, app developers;  apps;  architecture;  coordination cost;  decision rights;  ecosystems;  mobile apps;  modularity;  platforms,"Platform desertion, or a developer’s stopping the development of an app for a platform, is a widespread phenomenon to the detriment of platforms. However, the extant literature focuses primarily on why app developers join—not leave—a platform. This app-level study develops two ideas: (a) coordination costs borne by an app’s developer are associated with platform desertion, and (b) these costs are, in turn, shaped by a nuanced interplay between app decision rights and app “microarchitecture” introduced here. We use survey and snapshot archival data spanning 2009–2014 on over 300 apps in the Mozilla Firefox ecosystem to test these ideas. Our novel contribution shows how, by influencing coordination costs, the previously invisible interplay between app decision rights and app microarchitecture shapes an app’s platform desertion. We find that delegating app decision rights to its developer weakens the coordination cost-reducing benefits of decoupling an app from the platform but strengthens those of standardizing its interfaces to the platform. The key theoretical implication is that app decision rights and app microarchitecture symbiotically influence the coordination costs borne by an app’s developer. The key practical implication for platform designers is that the choices about who ought to make what decisions are intertwined with the architecture of the governed information technology artifact.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,40,77

Whinston,Two Formulas for Success in Social Media: Learning and Network Effects, learning;  network effects;  social contagion;  social media;  user-generated content,"Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented explosion in information technology that enables dynamic diffusion of user-generated content in social networks. Online videos, in particular, have changed the landscape of marketing and entertainment, competing with premium content and spurring business innovations. In the present study, we examine how learning and network effects drive the diffusion of online videos. While learning happens through informational externalities, network effects are direct payoff externalities. Using a unique data set from YouTube, we empirically identify learning and network effects separately, and find that both mechanisms have statistically and economically significant effects on video views; furthermore, the mechanism that dominates depends on the video type. Specifically, although learning primarily drives the popularity of quality-oriented content, network effects also make it possible for attention-grabbing content to go viral. Theoretically, we show that, unlike the diffusion of movies, it is the combination of both learning and network effects that generate the multiplier effect for the diffusion of online videos. From a managerial perspective, providers can adopt different strategies to promote their videos accordingly, that is, signaling the quality or featuring the viewer base depending on the video type. Our results also suggest that YouTube can play a much greater role in encouraging the creation of original content by leveraging the multiplier effect.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,78,108

BIT challenges the rubric that the percentage of good ideas will remain constant as the number of ideas generated rises. It is argued that limitations in solution space, goal congruence, attention span and knowledge typically result in the number of good ideas tapering off on an inflected curve. Six strategies are suggested for improving ideation sessions, which focus on promoting quality at the expense of quantity.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,1,123,144

The Contingent Effect of Facebook Likes on Sales Performance in Social Commerce", deal characteristics;  Facebook likes;  information asymmetry;  online sales;  product characteristics;  social commerce;  social network sites;  social utility,"In this study we investigate whether social reference systems, such as Facebook “likes” (FBLs), promote sales in social commerce, wherein adverse selection and quality uncertainty often severely damage consumer trust and impede efforts to achieve sustainable growth. We also examine the extent to which product characteristics (product uncertainty and product franchising) and deal characteristics (tipping points, discount rates, and deal durations) moderate the social selling stimulated by FBLs. On the basis of 1,327 samples collected from a major social commerce platform provider, we identify several interesting empirical regularities regarding the relationship between FBLs and social commerce sales. The findings suggest that FBLs drive traffic and increase sales. Information technology artifacts and social technologies, such as FBLs, can endow a consumer’s shopping experience with a socialization component and induce social selling in collective buying platforms. Nevertheless, significant variations occur across products and deals. For example, consumers who purchase experience goods more frequently depend on FBLs than do those who buy search goods. FBLs exert a far greater influence on the sales of goods from independent stores than those from franchise chains. Social commerce consumers are unaffected by heavy discount rates as they make purchase decisions, but they extensively rely on FBLs, particularly when purchasing products that have low tipping points. Our results suggest that social commerce can be a powerful marketplace when the economic utility that is driven by price incentives is further strengthened and protected by the social utility that originates from trust and sharing.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,109,143
303, HsiuJu Rebecca Yen;  Paul Jen-Hwa Hu;  Sheila Hsuan-Yu Hsu;  Eldon Y. Li,A Multilevel Approach to Examine Employees’ Loyal Use of ERP Systems in Organizations, information quality;  loyal use;  multilevel analysis;  perceived benefits;  perceived workload;  service-oriented organizational citizenship behaviors;  system quality,"A successful enterprise resource planning (ERP) system ultimately requires loyal use—proactive, extended use and willingness to recommend such uses to others—by employees. Building on interactional psychology literature and situational strength theory, we emphasize the importance of psychological commitment, in addition to behavioral manifestation, in a multilevel model of loyal use. Our empirical test of the model uses data from 485 employees and 166 information system professionals in 47 large Taiwanese organizations. Individual-level analyses suggest that perceived benefits and workload partially mediate the effects of perceived information quality (IQ) and system quality (SQ) on loyal use. Cross-level analyses show that IQ at the organizational level alleviates the negative effect of an employee’s perceived workload on loyal use; organization-level SQ and service-oriented organizational citizenship behaviors (SOCBs) of internal information systems staff reduce the influence of employees’ perceived benefits. Overall, our findings suggest that IQ, SQ, and SOCBs at the organizational level influence employees’ loyal use in ways different from their effects at the individual level, and seem to affect individuals’ cost–benefit analyses. This study contributes to extant literature by considering the SOCBs of the internal information systems group that have been overlooked by most prior research. Our findings offer insights for managers who should find ways to create positive, salient, shared views of IQ, SQ, and SOCBs in the organization to nourish and foster employees’ loyal use of an ERP system, including clearly demonstrating the system’s utilities and devising viable means to reduce the associated workload.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,144,178

For example, most extant research relies on mere portions of protection motivation theory (PMT) and has focused on isolated behaviors, thus limiting the generalizability of findings to isolated issues, rather than addressing the global set of protective security behaviors. Here, we investigate the motivations surrounding this larger behavioral set by assessing maladaptive rewards, response costs, and fear alongside traditional PMT components. We extend PMT by showing that: (1) security education, training, and awareness (SETA) efforts help form appraisals; (2) PMT’s applicability to organizational rather than personal contexts depends on insiders’ organizational commitment levels; and (3) response costs provide the link between PMT’s appraisals. We show in detail how organizational commitment is the mechanism through which organizational security threats become personally relevant to insiders and how SETA efforts influence many PMT-based components.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,179,214

Deception detection research in the information systems discipline has postulated increased accuracy through a new class of screening systems that automatically conduct interviews and track multiple indicators of deception simultaneously. Understanding the robustness of this new class of systems and the limitations of its theoretical improved performance is important for refinement of the conceptual design. The design science proof-of-concept study presented here implemented and evaluated the robustness of these systems for automated screening for deception detection. A large experiment was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a constructed multiple-indicator system, both under normal conditions and with the presence of common types of countermeasures (mental and physical). The results shed light on the relative strength and robustness of various types of deception indicators within this new context. The findings further suggest the possibility of increased accuracy through the measurement of multiple indicators if classification algorithms can compensate for human attempts to counter effectiveness.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,215,245

Specifically, the WOM valence paradox contends that higher WOM valence of a product results in a larger subsequent decrease in the WOM valence of the product, the WOM volume paradox propounds that higher WOM volume of a product results in a smaller subsequent increase in the WOM volume of the product, and the WOM spillover paradox proposes that an improvement in the WOM of a product also improves the WOM of connected products in a product network. These paradoxes caution online retailers that superior WOM may at times backfire and not boost further sales. Drawing theoretical support from expectation-confirmation theory and network theory, we collect data from China’s largest business-to-consumer platform, Tmall.com, and use linear panel data models to examine WOM evolution in a product network, controlling for relevant factors at the individual product, product network, and time unit levels. Importantly, we base our identification strategies on the use of instrumental variables and the difference-in-differences estimation approach. Numerous statistical checks confirm the robustness and consistency of our findings. We contribute to a much richer theoretical understanding of WOM, by extending the applicability of expectation-confirmation theory and network theory to novel predictions and contexts, adding a dynamic perspective, unveiling three important WOM paradoxes, and offering practical insights.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,246,284

However, empirical evidence has yet to be found illustrating whether and how such applications have affected job performance. Drawing upon social network theory, we postulate a conceptual model suggesting that employees’ online social relationships accumulated through work- and nonwork-related blog participation will engender different effects on job performance. The model is empirically tested using digital trace and archival data collected from two in-practice systems of a large telecommunications company. The results reveal that, in the work-related blog network, the structural and cognitive dimensions of social relationships positively affect job performance, whereas the relational dimension shows a negative influence. Meanwhile, participation in nonwork-related blog network benefits job performance for employees with a high level of performance in the previous time period, but is detrimental for other employees. The findings uncover the influencing mechanism of corporate blogging on job performance and offer practical advice for managers to better exploit the value of intraorganizational social media.",Journal of Management Information Systems,32,2015,4,285,314

Based on the dual pathway to creativity models, the authors examine the extent to which these tools are capable of stimulating individuals to explore their knowledge base more deeply (i.e., the persistence pathway) and more broadly (i.e., the flexibility pathway) and, hence, help to produce more novel ideas. In a laboratory study with business students, they find that, as compared to unaided individuals, IT-enabled stimuli providers enhance individual creativity more than process guides and mind mappers. As for the underlying creative process, stimuli providers push individuals to explore their knowledge base more deeply and more broadly, leading to more novel but, unexpectedly, also more useful ideas. The reported findings may facilitate the development of creativity support systems and their assignment to individuals and tasks.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,11,44

In this paper, we propose a structural risk model to analyze malware propagation dynamics measured by a four-parameter (asymptote, point of inflection, rate, and infection proportion at inflection) growth curve. Using both social network data and technological network infrastructure from a large organization, we estimate the proposed structural risk model based on incident-specific nonlinear growth curves. This paper provides empirical evidence for the explanatory power of the structural characteristics of the underlying networks on malware propagation dynamics. This research provides useful findings for security managers in designing their malware defense strategies. We also simulate three common malware defense strategies (preselected immunization strategies, countermeasure dissemination strategies, and security awareness programs) based on the proposed structural risk model and show that they outperform existing strategies in terms of reducing the size of malware infection.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,296,325

In this paper, we synthesize prior literature from different academic domains and propose users’ perceived quality of five design elements (i.e., unity, complexity, intensity, novelty, and interactivity) as determinants of website aesthetics. We further theorize the effects of aesthetics on users’ attitudes toward the website and their perception of the corporate image. Two studies were conducted to test the research model. In Study 1, we adopted a card sorting method and the results provide substantial support to the determinants of website aesthetics. In Study 2, we conducted a survey using ten company portal websites that were unknown to survey respondents. Our analysis further confirms the effects of users’ perceived quality of the five design elements on the perception of website aesthetics. The findings of Study 2 also show that users’ perception of aesthetics has significant impacts on perceived utility and their attitudes toward the website, which further affects the corporate image exhibited via the website. In addition, we find that in users’ first interaction with a website, perceived aesthetics has a larger impact on their attitudes toward the website than perceived utility.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,229,259

However, in this paper we show that the stylized fact is not true in certain circumstances. We theorize that the valence and volume of prior reviews can play an important moderating role in the effect of deal promotion. Empirically, we show that restaurants with a relatively low prior average rating and a relatively small review volume have improved their online reputations by offering Groupon promotion. The proportion of such restaurants is substantial. The findings are robust to multiple identification strategies and econometric specifications. The results underscore the substantial heterogeneity in the effect of deal promotion on local merchants’ online reputations. Merchants need to understand the moderating role of prior reviews (e.g., the valence and volume of prior reviews) and design appropriate strategies to maximize the returns from offering deal promotion.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,171,201

Information systems (IS) that support business intelligence and analytics help managers access and analyze data from various sources, thereby providing insight into potential opportunities. Building on the dynamic managerial capability perspective, we investigate the extent to which two managerial IS use behaviors—routine use and innovative use—influence a manager’s volume and diversity of ideas for organizational innovation. We also examine the moderating role of three organization-level entrepreneurial orientation characteristics—autonomy, innovativeness, and risk taking. We test our research model with survey data collected from 248 managers. Our results show that routine IS use is not related to volume or diversity of ideas for organizational innovation. However, innovative IS use is positively related to idea volume and idea diversity. Furthermore, organizational autonomy and innovativeness positively moderate the aforementioned innovative use/idea relationships. Our study contributes to the literature by linking postadoptive IS use behaviors to managerial sensing ability, an important dynamic managerial capability. We also further the understanding of how organizational factors such as entrepreneurial orientation play a key role in determining whether, when, and how managers use IS to develop ideas for organizational innovation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,45,69

Using a data set from YouTube, we examine how cascades of WOM interactions enhance the popularity of videos. We first estimate the impact of channel influence and other network parameters in initiating WOM communications. The probit estimation considers the selection effect in videos that are likely to be associated with a greater propensity to trigger WOM. We find that factors related to a channel’s ability to be a connector and a translator is most likely to result in the incidence of WOM. We then examine how cascades of WOM conversations have persistent impacts on subsequent video popularity. Empirically, the main issue here is heterogeneity in the epidemic potential of a video. Since the threshold might vary across videos, we use a finite mixture model. We also conduct a simultaneous estimation using latent instrumental variables to address endogeneity from unobservables. Our research has implications for researchers and practitioners by highlighting how WOM travels through networks of influence and susceptibility in disseminating awareness, and holds insights in regard to designing social recommendation systems and identifying trending topics in social media.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,139,170

Although it is widespread and recent empirical studies have detected that in-house IT can complement IT outsourcing, when and how concurrent IT sourcing pays off is not yet understood. This study introduces the notion of concurrent IT sourcing. It then develops two interrelated ideas: concurrent IT sourcing simultaneously enhances in-house and outsourced IT performance: (a) via distinctive mechanisms, but (b) only when vendors’ IT capabilities complement the client’s. Econometric tests using survey data from 233 firms support these ideas. Our novel contribution is to explain when and how concurrent IT sourcing enhances a client firm’s inhouse and outsourced IT performance. The explanatory mechanisms for outsourced IT performance are socialization and modeling of clients’ in-house IT practices by vendors; for in-house IT performance they are knowledge spillovers and ratcheting. For practice, our study shows that when a firm’s in-house capabilities complement its IT vendors’ capabilities, firms can simultaneously outsource and insource the same IT activities to enhance both in-house and outsourced IT performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,101,138

While the free offering helps capture potential customers, it might cannibalize the sales of premium goods or services. This paper adopts a game theoretical approach to examine the impact of free offering on the competition between two firms in the presence of network effects. The firms can either offer a free core product and a paid service or offer them as a bundle. The core product has stand-alone value and can be used separately but the value-added service has no value without the core product. We derive the market equilibria and present conditions under which the free offering strategy outperforms the bundling strategy. We show that when a firm’s core product has a sufficient advantage in product quality, it is better for this firm to sell the bundle but for the other to use free strategy. However, if the core products are similar in terms of quality, it is optimal for them to use the same strategies. Whether to offer a free product depends largely on the core products’ quality. We also show that the firms may be caught in a prisoner’s dilemma when both adopt the free strategy. Finally, we find that the profitability of the firm that offers a free product always increases in network effects intensity and market size, but this is not the case for the firm that sells the bundle. This study contributes to understanding the behavior of feature-limited free offering in a duopoly setting. Our findings also provide insights into the design of free product and the impact of network effects on the firms’ offering decisions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,260,295

However, extrinsic motivation may have unintended consequences. Although past studies have examined the direct effect of extrinsic motivation on intrinsic motivation, no research to date has investigated how extrinsic motivation moderates the impact of intrinsic motivation on knowledge sharing, or how the effect of extrinsic motivation on intrinsic motivation is contingent upon whether a member is active or not. Drawing on attribution theory and theory of planned behavior, the study was conducted with data collected from a large social Q&A site consisting of multiple online communities with millions of registered users; the data were analyzed with moderated regression and structural equation modeling. Results show that the effect of enjoyment in helping others on attitude toward knowledge sharing is undermined by virtual organizational rewards, while the effect of knowledge self-efficacy on attitude toward knowledge sharing is undermined by reciprocity. The results also show that the effect of virtual organizational rewards on enjoyment in helping others is contingent upon whether members are active or not. Specifically, for active members, virtual organizational rewards undermine enjoyment in helping others; for inactive members, however, virtual organizational rewards increase enjoyment in helping others. These findings enrich the research on unintended consequences of extrinsic motivation specifically, and the theory of motivation in general. Additionally, these findings provide practical insights on how and when to use extrinsic rewards/goals to motivate individuals to share knowledge in social Q&A sites.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,70,100

Although prior studies generally agree on the importance of online WOM, we have little knowledge of the interplay between online user reviews and professional reviews. This paper empirically investigates a mediation model in which online user reviews mediate the impact of professional reviews on online user decisions. Using software download data, we show that a higher professional rating not only directly promotes software download but also results in more active user-generated WOM interactions, which indirectly lead to more downloads. The indirect impact of professional reviews can be as large as 20 percent of the corresponding total impact. These findings deepen our understanding of online WOM effect, and provide managerial suggestions about WOM marketing and the prediction of online user choices.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,1,202,228

Extant models for automated online fake review detection rely heavily on verbal behaviors of reviewers while largely ignoring their nonverbal behaviors. This research identifies a variety of nonverbal behavioral features of online reviewers and examines their relative importance for the detection of fake reviews in comparison to that of verbal behavioral features. The results of an empirical evaluation using real-world online reviews reveal that incorporating nonverbal features of reviewers can significantly improve the performance of online fake review detection models. Moreover, compared with verbal features, nonverbal features of reviewers are shown to be more important for fake review detection. Furthermore, model pruning based on a sensitivity analysis improves the parsimony of the developed fake review detection model without sacrificing its performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,2,456,481

Literature documents the existence of many online Internet Relay Chat (IRC) cybercriminal communities where cybercriminals congregate and share hacking tools, malware, and more. However, many cybercriminal community participants appear unskilled and have fleeting interests, making it difficult to detect potential long-term or key participants. This is a challenge for researchers and practitioners to quickly identify cybercriminals that may provide credible threat intelligence. Thus, we propose a computational approach to analyze cybercriminals IRC communities in order to identify potential long-term and key participants. We use the extended Cox model to scrutinize cybercriminal IRC participation for better understanding of behaviors exhibited by cybercriminals of importance. Results indicate that key cybercriminals may be quickly identifiable by assessing the scale of their interaction and networks with other participants.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,2,482,510

The central idea behind the DLC strategy, zero-day DLCs in particular, is that consumers who find the base version of a game to be sufficiently close to their tastes would want more of its capabilities and would pay a premium to upgrade by purchasing a DLC. To better understand the implications of such a product-line strategy, in this work, we combine the literature on versioning with that on consumer learning. In doing so, we uncover an interesting economic phenomenon that, for an experience good, a manufacturer’s desire to vertically differentiate could actually stem from its inability to otherwise elicit unobserved heterogeneity in consumers’ perceived fit. In other words, we generalize versioning to accommodate both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,2,546,572

We empirically assess the predictive ability of our framework using an ordinal multilevel regression model. Results indicate that deceivers minimize the use of referencing and self-deprecation but include more superfluous descriptions and flattery. Deceitful channel partners also overstructure their arguments and rapidly mimic the linguistic style of the account manager across dyadic e-mail exchanges.

Prior deception research using eye trackers has focused on the detection and interpretation of brief oculometric variations in response to stimuli (e.g., specific images or interview questions). However, more research is needed to understand how variations in oculometric behaviors evolve over the course of an interaction with a deception detection system. Using latent growth curve modeling, we tested hypotheses explaining how two oculometric behaviors—pupil dilation and eye-gaze fixation patterns—evolve over the course of a system interaction for three groups of participants: deceivers who see relevant stimuli (i.e., stimuli pertinent to their deception), deceivers who do not see relevant stimuli, and truth-tellers. The results indicate that the oculometric indicators of deceivers evolve differently over the course of an interaction, and that these trends are indicative of deception regardless of whether relevant stimuli are shown.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,2,332,360

Weber,Product Pricing in a Peer-to-Peer Economy, collaborative consumption;  market equilibrium;  monopoly pricing;  overlapping generations;  peer-to-peer economy;  product pricing;  sharing economy,"The emergence of a collaborative economy has been driven by advances in information technology that allow consumers to borrow and rent goods among peers on a secondary sharing market. In a dynamic setting, consumers make intertemporal decisions about purchases and their participation in the sharing market. This study introduces an overlapping-generations model to analyze product pricing and consumer choice with and without a sharing market. The model quantifies the impacts of a peer-to-peer economy on the demand for ownership, the product price, and all participants’ payoffs, including consumer surplus, profits, and social welfare. Given consumers that are heterogeneous with respect to their consumption needs and valuations, it illustrates which of them are prone to participate in a sharing economy and whether a retailer (or manufacturer) can benefit from the presence of a secondary exchange. A sharing market tends to increase the price of new products by a “sharing premium,” which positively depends on the retailer’s commitment ability. The price increment becomes relatively smaller for higher-cost products. Low-cost products and sufficiently impatient consumers together make a peer-to-peer economy unattractive for retailers. For high-cost products, however, the latter stand to gain from the existence of a sharing market. Most important, the introduction of a peer-to-peer economy increases both consumer surplus and social welfare, thus creating an implicit imperative for a social planner to help promote collaborative consumption, for instance, by providing incentives for retailers and manufacturers that tend to offset possible expected negative payoff effects from consumer sharing.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,2,573,596

In the context of complex computer systems, however, defenses can also have the opposite effect, creating new, unforeseen vulnerabilities in the systems they are intended to protect. Advocacy for defense-in-depth and diverse security measures has contributed to this “more is better” mentality for defending computer systems, which fails to consider the complex interaction of different components in these systems, especially with regard to what impact new security controls may have on the operation and functionality of other, preexisting defenses. We give examples of several categories of perverse effects in defending computer systems and draw on the theory of unintended consequences and the duality of technology to analyze the origins of these perverse effects, and to develop a classification scheme for the different types and some methods for avoiding them.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,2,597,620

In this study we develop and test a model that explains how online customer behavior is influenced by a firm’s recovery endeavors when privacy breaches occur. Drawing on a service recovery perspective, we integrate the notions of justice perceptions and psychological responses into a theoretical framework. The proposed model was tested against data collected from 1,007 online customers based on a hypothetical scenario. Results show that three types of justice perceptions, distributive, procedural, and interactional justice, jointly affect psychological responses—that is, perceived breach and feelings of violation. In addition, psychological responses were shown to be important in shaping postincident outcomes such as post-word of mouth and post-likelihood of switching. The study gives researchers and practitioners a useful conceptual tool for analyzing the effectiveness of organizational practices in recovering customer relationship after privacy breaches.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,3,904,933

During the simulation session, the commander in charge allocates airborne and standby resources and dispatches or diverts aircraft to intercept intruders. Seventy-four simulation sessions were conducted in order to examine the effects of time pressure and completeness of information on the performance of twenty-nine top IAF commanders. Variables examined were: (1) display of complete versus incomplete information, (2) time-constrained decision making versus unlimited decision time, and (3) the difference in performance between top strategic commanders and mid-level field commanders. The authors' results show that complete information usually improved performance. However, field commanders (as opposed to top strategic commanders) did not improve their performance when presented with complete information under pressure of time. Time pressure usually, but not always, impaired performance. Top commanders tended to make fewer changes in previous decisions than did field commanders.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,2,153,172

This study reports on the testing of a previously published contingency model in which two different structural forms are modeled for four states of EUC implementation: (1) an organic design (characterized by a decentralized, highly participatory form of decision making with loose controls), and (2) a mechanistic design (characterized by centralized decision making with a more tightly controlled form of management). Based on questionnaire data from 63 companies, statistical support is found for only the two states of EUC implementation for which a mechanistic design is modeled. Although only moderate support for this contingency model is found, the results of this study provide additional evidence for the effectiveness of a more controlled approach to EUC management under a low EUC growth objective at an early stage of implementation. This finding has important implications for other EUC management models and organization design options for assimilating new information technologies in general. The article concludes with recommendations for future empirical research, including a revised contingency model.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1994,4,183,211

This study explores their impact on firm profitability, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Using an analytical model, we show that firms take advantage of such infomediaries and reduce their own information investments, increasing their profitability. Surprisingly, we find that the existence of these websites may actually reduce social welfare. Contrary to the common belief that product information websites are good for buyers, we show that they may be hurting consumers, even when they seek to maximize consumer surplus as their principal goal. These findings question the uncritical acceptance of infomediaries as beneficial to markets in general, and buyers in particular, especially when the infomediaries assume roles that substitute the information disclosure investments that sellers freely choose to make.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,3,624,651

Our study examines the intertwining of cognition and a specific emotion, regret, in IT real options decision making using a multisite case study of IT investments. We develop a process model that explains the context in which regret is triggered, the strategies used to regulate regret, and how these strategies influence the valuation, creation, exercise, and revaluation of several types of IT real options. Our research highlights that while some regret regulation strategies may be productive, others are counterproductive. Our findings extend the studies on cognition-based models of IT real options by including emotion, which allows us to explore human behavior on a psychological level and offer a more fundamental understanding of IT real options thinking. Practitioners must recognize the presence of regret that could cloud cognition-based analysis and must be sensitive to its impact.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,3,652,683

Previous research has proposed that groups, like individuals, have a general factor of collective intelligence, an ability to perform consistently across multiple types of tasks. We studied groups that used computer-mediated communication (CMC) to investigate whether collective intelligence is similar or different when groups work using CMC. A collective intelligence factor did not emerge among groups using CMC, suggesting that collective intelligence manifests itself differently depending on context. This is in contrast to previous findings. Our results surface a need for more research on boundary conditions of the construct of collective intelligence. Our findings also have practical implications: managers should take care when organizing virtual group work because groups that perform well on one type of task will not necessarily be the groups that do well on other tasks",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,3,684,712

Unfortunately, they are largely ineffective, as shown by prior research. A key contributor to this failure is habituation: decreased response to a repeated warning. Previous research has only inferred the occurrence of habituation to warnings, or measured it indirectly, such as through the proxy of a related behavior. Therefore, there is a gap in our understanding of how habituation to security warnings develops in the brain. Without direct measures of habituation, we are limited in designing warnings that can mitigate its effects. In this study, we use neurophysiological measures to directly observe habituation as it occurs in the brain and behaviorally. We also design a polymorphic warning artifact that repeatedly changes its appearance in order to resist the effects of habituation. In an experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 25), we found that our polymorphic warning was significantly more resistant to habituation than were conventional warnings in regions of the brain related to attention. In a second experiment (n = 80), we implemented the four most resistant polymorphic warnings in a realistic setting. Using mouse cursor tracking as a surrogate for attention to unobtrusively measure habituation on participants’ personal computers, we found that polymorphic warnings reduced habituation compared to conventional warnings. Together, our findings reveal the substantial influence of neurobiology on users’ habituation to security warnings and security behavior in general, and we offer our polymorphic warning design as an effective solution to practice",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,3,713,743

Drawing on users’ different dispositional attribution of these trusting beliefs, we investigate the different influence of two sets of experiential reasons on the competence belief versus the benevolence and integrity beliefs in online recommendation agents (RAs). The two sets of experiential reasons encompass interactive reason, including three performance factors (namely, perceived cognitive effort, advice quality, and perceived strategy restrictiveness), and knowledge-based reason (i.e., perceived transparency of an RA). Data were collected through a laboratory experiment to test our hypotheses. Results demonstrate that the three performance factors affect only the competence belief, whereas perceived RA transparency influences all three trusting beliefs. In addition, the effects of perceived transparency on competence are partially mediated by perceived cognitive effort and advice quality. The research contributes to the trust literature by revealing the different antecedents of the three trusting beliefs and provides guidelines for designers to choose specific design elements to improve a particular trusting belief of the user toward an RA.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,3,744,775

AVDO is implemented in an augmented world setting that integrates real visual cues with a virtual-world technology (Second Life® in this case). The assessment of AVDO is carried out in two ways: (1) through a synthesis of the extended MN theory and technology acceptance theories to assess the relationships of design features as perceived by patients with outcomes that include understanding, perceived effectiveness, trust, and behavior intentions, and (2) through the assessment of AVDO’s proof of value and proof of use as a supplementary channel for the delivery of medical care.

First, we explore the relationship between firms’ vertical and horizontal boundaries and information technology (IT) capabilities. The literature postulates that less internalization leads firms to invest more in information technology. However, we argue that the use of taper integration and diversification increases the demand for IT-based resources such as IT infrastructure and IT human resources. Second, we propose that the fit between information processing needs and capacity has a positive effect on performance. Our hypotheses are tested on a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms, and the results provide general support for our arguments. One advantage of the data is that they include not only large firms but also small and medium-size manufacturers. From a theoretical perspective, the study contributes to the literature by providing novel insights on how decisions on the vertical dimension condition investments in IT capabilities. It also adds new evidence on the diversification–IT capabilities relationship and studies the consequences of alignment of corporate strategies and IT capabilities on firm performance. From a managerial perspective, our study suggests that changes in the vertical and horizontal limits should be followed by changes in IT capabilities to improve performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,3,809,842

Drawing on a panel data set of more than 23,300 crowdfunding campaigns from Indiegogo, we investigate the dynamic effects of these social interactions on consumers’ funding decisions using the panel vector autoregressive methodology. Our analysis shows that both eWOM and popularity information are critical influencing mechanisms in crowdfunding. However, our overarching finding is that eWOM surrounding crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo or Facebook has a significant yet substantially weaker predictive power than popularity information. We also find that whereas popularity information has a more immediate effect on consumers’ funding behavior, its effectiveness decays rather quickly, while the impact of eWOM recedes more slowly. This study contributes to the extant literature by (1) providing a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic effects of opinion-based and action-based social interactions, (2) unraveling both within-platform and cross-platform dynamics, and (3) showing that social interactions are perceived as quality indicators on crowdfunding platforms that help consumers reduce risks associated with their investment decisions.

Experiment results showed that the system outperforms benchmark methods by a large margin. Novel features we proposed made weighty contributions to the prediction. In addition to designing a decision support system with practical utility, we also analyzed key factors of movie profitability. Furthermore, we demonstrated the prescriptive value of our system by illustrating how it can be used to recommend a set of profit-maximizing cast members.

Central to several models of trust and virtual collaboration is user's disposition to trust. This construct, however, has generally been conceptualized in as a stand-alone trait without a substantive theoretical background in personality theory. This paper advances the interpersonal circumplex model (ICM) as a theoretical framework for understanding the role of personal traits in collaboration in virtual contexts. The ICM posits that tendencies in interpersonal interaction stem from personal dispositions that can be understood in terms of dimensions of power and affiliation, fundamental constituents of user's personality. We develop a model that proposes that interpersonal traits, specifically, personality type as defined by the circumplex, affect the individual's disposition to trust, perceived trustworthiness, communication, and thereby affects willingness to collaborate and the sustainability and productivity of the collaboration. The model enables us to unpack the black box concepts of disposition to trust, faith in others, and trusting stance that are currently incorporated in theories of trust in information systems. The theory also enables explanation of trust dynamics at the dyadic and group levels. We develop propositions positing that individual's traits and dyadic complementarity are mediating factors in interpersonal trust and willingness to use new technologies and significantly affect the initiation, duration, and productivity of computer-mediated collaboration.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2004,4,115,137

Appropriate design and implementation of IS integration is typically a precondition for enabling a majority of the anticipated business benefits of a combined organization. Often, IS integration projects are subject to deficiencies (e.g., loss of the target firm’s business capabilities with expedited integration) that limit value creation. Drawing on a configurational perspective, we reanalyze 37 published case studies of problematic IS integrations and identify the potential deficiencies and how they are produced. Our findings reveal nine causal configurations that together explain deficiency as a consequence of multiple paths of interconnected mechanisms and contextual conditions that drive their actualization. Finally, based on a post hoc analysis of 25 cases where no negative outcomes are reported, we discuss approaches for managing IS integration to avoid realizing the actualization of deficiencies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,942,977

Trust is especially important for globally distributed collaboration in light of the lack of face-to-face interactions. As the perception of trust is a dynamic process, however, little research is conducted measuring trust development. Whether facilitation intervention is beneficial for trust development is also unknown. In order to fill the research gaps, we followed a design science approach and incorporated collaboration engineering into the design of the treatment. Data were collected in a series of experiments with Chinese and U.S. mixed teams, including a longitudinal survey, interviews, and documentation. Through the comparison of the treatment group with the control group, we found that trust was significantly improved in the treatment group. In addition, several trust antecedents were found to explain the development. The power of facilitated collaboration is also validated as helpful for trust development. This research makes several implications, such as proposing a series of trust antecedents, a treatment design of a collaboration engineering (CE) approach for trust improvement, and a new context application of CE. This research could also help the practitioners in globally distributed collaboration who want to improve trust over time.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,978,1007

Using Gowalla data with 385,306 users, 3 million locations, and 35 million check-in records, we empirically estimate the model to find evidence on the homophily effect on network formation. To cope with possible endogeneity issues, we use exogenous weather shocks as our instrumental variables and find the empirical results are robust: network formation decisions are significantly affected by our proximity measures.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,1008,1033

We present a targeted approach to Twitter sentiment analysis for brands using supervised feature engineering and the dynamic architecture for artificial neural networks. The proposed approach addresses challenges associated with the unique characteristics of the Twitter language and brand-related tweet sentiment class distribution. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Twitter data sets related to two distinctive brands. The supervised feature engineering for brands offers final tweet feature representations of only seven dimensions with greater feature density. Reducing the dimensionality of the representations reduces the complexity of the classification problem and feature sparsity. Two sets of experiments are conducted for each brand in three-class and five-class tweet sentiment classification. We examine five-class classification to target the mild sentiment expressions that are of particular interest to firms and brand management practitioners. We compare the proposed approach to the performances of two state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment analysis systems from the academic and commercial domains. The results indicate that it outperforms these state-of-the-art systems by wide margins, with classification F1-measures as high as 88 percent and excellent recall of tweets expressing mild sentiments. Furthermore, they demonstrate the tweet feature representations, though consisting of only seven dimensions, are highly effective in capturing indicators of Twitter sentiment expression. The proposed approach and vast majority of features identified through supervised feature engineering are applicable across brands, allowing researchers and brand management practitioners to quickly generate highly effective tweet feature representations for Twitter sentiment analysis on other brands.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,1034,1058

We evaluated the AZSecure system on eight international underground economy forums. The system significantly outperformed all benchmark machine-learning methods on identifying advertisement threads, classifying customer review sentiments, and profiling seller characteristics, with an average F-measure of about 80 percent to 90 percent. In our case study, we identified the famous carder, Rescator, who was affiliated with the Target breach, and captured important seller characteristics in terms of product type, payment options, and contact channels.

This study draws on dual-system theory (DST), borrowed from cognitive neuroscience (also known as reflective-impulsive theory of the mind and fast and slow thinking) to investigate what drives this phenomenon. The statistical analyses of time-lagged data collected from 341 Facebook users implicate an imbalance between two systems in the human mind, involving strong cognitive-emotional preoccupation with using the SNS (System 1, impulsive) and weak cognitive-behavioral control over using the SNS (System 2, reflective), as the driver of problematic SNS use behaviors. Problematic use of SNS, in turn, diminishes users’ academic performance. This study contributes to research on the dark side of information systems (IS) use by conceptualizing problematic use and explaining its drivers and consequences. It demonstrates that the dual-system theory is an appropriate theoretical perspective for explaining problematic IS use, superior to planned-behavior–based models. It also explains some of the precursors of the dual system factors and offers practical implications to information technology artifact designers and users.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,1087,1116

We performed laboratory experiments in all four countries. We used three experimental treatments: (1) no assurances; (2) promises of product quality and authenticity; and (3) promises backed up by third-party assurances. We examined subjects’ perceived risk associated with different treatments across different vendor types. The impact of treatments and of vendor reputation on consumers’ trust varied across countries in ways that we did not expect. In mature online markets like the United States, online shopping appears to be treated as just another form of shopping. In China, if an online vendor can establish a reputation for quality, consumers appear to treat those merchants much as Americans do their own favorite online vendors, despite problems with Chinese shopping more generally.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,1117,1148

A hierarchical view, premised in institutional theory and competitive dynamics, leads to a model that explains firms’ practices. This model includes factors that pertain to the environment (environmental awareness and government regulations), industry (industry norms and competitors’ green practices), and firm (customers’ and equity holders’ attitudes and internal readiness) levels. Survey data collected from 304 major firms in Taiwan are used to test the model and hypotheses. In particular, attitudes of a firm’s customers and equity holders, as well as its internal readiness, directly influence its green IT practices, while also channeling the effects of important contextual factors. Among the contextual factors considered herein, environmental awareness and industry norms influence firms’ practices both directly and indirectly. The overall results highlight the significance of contextual factors and underscore the mediating roles of firm-specific considerations. According to our findings, firms should implement strategic goals and make resource allocations toward green IT practices that are aligned with the industry-wide atmosphere and general public’s awareness of environmental protection.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,1149,1179

Yet there is still little empirical evidence that implementation of SIS results in long-term competitive advantages. This is primarily due to the difficulty of isolating economic benefits attributable to SIS implementation. In this research, thirty-five sample firms identified in the media for successful employment of SIS are analyzed for evidence of long-term financial success. This analysis is conducted over a thirteen-year period, centered around the year in which firms were identified for employment of SIS to either support growth, control costs, form alliances, differentiate products, or provide innovation of products/processes. Results show that the stock market reacted favorably to announcements that firms were using SIS, and in subsequent years those firms tended to be more productive and more profitable than their industries and than firms in their respective industries. The greatest profitability differences occurred in the years after SIS firms were initially recognized as successfully employing SIS or investing in SIS. Further, a subsample analysis revealed that the positive results were primarily driven by those firms employing SIS to support growth.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1995,4,215,248

However, in the public sector, the board of directors does not exist and there may be less need to focus on the controlling aspect of governance and more need to focus on the politically challenging distribution of state resources. In this U.S.-state–based study, we adopt, apply, and extend the legal view of agency theory past its sole focus on the board of directors as the solitary mediating hierarch in order to examine the strategic mediating hierarch role played by the state legislature and then conceptualize and test for the existence of a tactical mediating hierarch played by the IT steering committee and the production role of an independent Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) in using a fee-for-service funding model. We apply these concepts to extend theory to examine the combination of roles that lead to superior outcomes for the state (the principal) versus those necessary for the IT department (the agent). Our results show that by shifting from the control-oriented view of governance in the private sector to a more mediating view in the public sector, important practices may be portable between the public and private sector, despite their widely differing structures.",Journal of Management Information Systems,33,2016,4,1180,1208

We further theorize that the UTAUT constructs, in concert with gender, age, and experience, predict intention to use a collaboration technology, which in turn predicts use. We conducted two field studies in Finland among (1) 349 short message service (SMS) users and (2) 447 employees who were potential users of a new collaboration technology in an organization.

Despite this importance, surprisingly little research has measured the effectiveness of various requirements elicitation techniques. The present research first discusses theory relevant to information requirements determination in general and elicitation in particular. We then develop a model of the requirements elicitation process. This model and its underlying theory were then used to construct a new requirements elicitation prompting technique. To provide a context for testing the relative effectiveness of the new technique, two other questioning methodologies were also operationalized as prompting techniques: (1) the interrogatories technique, which involves asking ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" ""how,"" and ""why"" questions, and (2) a semantic questioning scheme, which involves asking questions based on a theoretical model of knowledge structures. To measure the usefulness of the prompting techniques in eliciting requirements, a set of generic requirements categories was adapted from previous research to capture requirements evoked by users. The effectiveness of the three methods in eliciting requirements for a software application was then tested in an experiment with users.

Using survey data from 371 employees working in 133 different branches of the organization, we find that several aspects of the social networks relate to quality of employees' adaptation to the new technology as assessed by the company's departmental directors. Specifically, the size of the support network as well as the strength and density of the information network significantly predict employees' adaptation to the new system. We conclude the paper by discussing theoretical implications for the relevance of social network research for members' adaptation to organizational changes as well as outlining specific implications for practice.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,177,206

Study 1 manipulated the interface affordances of mediation, contingency, and modality richness. Study 2 examined the affordance of mediation. Results show that interfaces that promote higher mutuality and involvement lead to more favorable perceptions of partners' credibility and attraction, and those perceptions are systematically related to higher-quality decisions and more influence.

However, most variables such as user satisfaction and system usage can only be measured after system implementation. To predict system success before actual implementation, behavioral theories indicate that it is necessary to evaluate behavioral intention or users' motivation to use the system. Expectancy theory is considered one of the most promising models of individual motivation. This study examines the use of expectancy theory in explaining the motivation to use an expert system. Data gathered from 95 M.B.A. students in a judgmental modeling exercise suggest that the model is a significant predictor of motivation. It also provides insight into the development of such systems. The successful use of this model further suggests that it is appropriate for evaluating and understanding individual motivation to use a system and, subsequently, system success.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,3,183,198

This paper shows the effect of new electronic distribution technologies such as PC banking on the choice of a bank's distribution strategy. We present a competitive model of distribution strategy choice, including heterogeneous consumers and banks, that allows a rich variety of customer preference and technology cost parameters. Sensitivity analysis shows how several parameters affect the competitive outcome. This analysis suggests that changing consumer behavior and attitudes, instead of banks' cost structure with new technologies significantly affects the bank's distribution strategy choice. If the segment of consumers that prefers PC banking remains small relative to the segment that prefers branches, then there will still be a market for specialized branch banks. Branch banking without PC banking services will be a viable strategy until the segment that prefers PC banking grows larger (amounting to about 40 percent of all transactions). Banks offering both branch and PC banking services can prevent successful and profitable entry by virtual banks (Internet banks offering only PC banking services) as long as the segment of customers that prefer PC banking remains relatively small (less than two-thirds of all transactions). Beyond this fraction, virtual banks will be profitable. This analysis suggests that it may be a long time (if ever) before virtual banks turn a profit.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,2,133,156

The knowledge engineers were asked to rate issues related to successful implementation, the extent of use in key areas, the original motivations for implementation, the perceived benefits, and the effects on end users of the systems. Factor analysis (varimax rotation) was used to reduce the number of issues so that reasonable conclusions in these areas could be drawn. The study resulted in several findings. Among these are: (i) knowledge acquisition and knowledge engineering should be separated in the overall ES development process and assigned to different ES team members; (ii) knowledge acquisition is the ""bottleneck"" in ES development; (iii) expert systems benefit organizations by helping personnel make more consistent, timely, and accurate decisions in hopes of improving competitiveness; and (iv) expert systems have not had dysfunctional effects on end users, such as lower job satisfaction, as seen in other automated technologies studies.

IT infrastructure expenditures account for over 58 percent of an organization's IT budget and the percentage is growing at 11 percent a year. Some even have called IT infrastructure the new competitive weapon and see it as being crucial in developing a sustained competitive advantage. Unique characteristics of an IT infrastructure determine the value of that infrastructure to an organization. One characteristic, IT infrastructure flexibility, has captured the attention of researchers and practitioners. In fact, in most recent surveys featuring issues of most importance to IT executives, the development of a flexible and responsive IT infrastructure and related topics are always at or near the top of the responses. Although the importance of IT infrastructure flexibility has been established, the development of a valid, reliable instrument to measure this construct has not been reported in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to better define the IT infrastructure flexibility construct and to develop a valid, reliable measurement instrument for this construct. In addition to the definition and operationalization of the IT infrastructure flexibility construct, this study explores the instrument's predictive validity with possible antecedent and consequent variables.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,1,167,208

How should the intermediary charge suppliers and buyers to maximize profits from such a marketplace. We analyze a monopolistic B2B marketplace owned by an independent intermediary. The marketplace exhibits two-sided network effects where the value of the marketplace to buyers is dependent on the number of suppliers, and the value to suppliers is dependent on the number of buyers and suppliers. When these two-sided network effects exist, we find that the optimal price for buyers and the fraction of buyers in the electronic market are dependent on the switching cost and the strength of the network effect of both types: buyers and suppliers. The same is true for the optimal price for suppliers and the fraction of suppliers in the electronic market. In other words, the parameters that define the buyers also affect the optimal price for suppliers and the fraction of suppliers in the electronic market, and vice versa. Our results also point some counterintuitive optimal pricing strategies that depend on the nature of the industry served by the marketplace.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,43,68

This study finds that these two forms of governance often conflict with one another. We contribute to the research on IT outsourcing governance by opening the black box of the evolutionary process of achieving ambidexterity in this context. Organizations shift their focus between contractual and relational forms of governance in an attempt to develop practices that address conflicts between the two forms.

Different functional modules share data, which are typically stored in multiple local databases. Functional modules are usually not integrated across channels, as channels are implemented at different times within independent software projects and are subject to varying requirements of availability and performance. This lack of channel and functional integration raises data quality problems that can impact the quality of the products and services of an organization. In particular, in complex systems in which data are managed in multiple databases, timeliness is critical. This paper focuses on time-related factors of data quality and provides a model that can help companies to evaluate data currency, accuracy, and completeness in software architectures with different degrees of integration across channels and functionalities. The model is validated through simulation based on empirical data on financial information systems. Results indicate how architectural choices on the degree of data integration have a varying impact on currency, accuracy, and completeness depending on the type of financial institution and on customer profiles.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,3,71,91

Early diffusion models explaining technology diffusion patterns assumed that there is a single homogeneous segment of potential adopters. It was later shown that a two-segment model considering two groups of adopters explains variations in diffusion patterns better than the existing one-segment models. While the two-segment model considers a group of adopters promoting adoption by exerting a positive influence on prospective adopters, it does not consider the members of society who aim to inhibit the adoption process by exerting a negative influence on prospective adopters. In fact, most IT innovations face opposition. Yet it is not clear how opposition affects the diffusion process. In this paper, we model the diffusion of an IT innovation through its target population with three types of actors: influentials, who are autonomous in adopting new technology and promote its adoption; opponents, who are opposed to the technology and inhibit its adoption; and imitators, who are information seekers, thus affected by both influentials and opponents. We show that opponents play a crucial role in determining the diffusion path of an innovation. The empirical tests using real as well as simulated data sets demonstrate the ability of our model to fit the data better and to identify the segments of adopters correctly.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,305,334

An examination of current practices reveals that managers view security investment as any other and use traditional decision-theoretic risk management techniques to determine security investments. We argue in this paper that this method is incomplete because of the problem's strategic nature--hackers alter their hacking strategies in response to a firm's investment strategies. We propose game theory for determining IT security investment levels and compare game theory and decision theory approaches on several dimensions such as the investment levels, vulnerability, and payoff from investments. We show that the sequential game results in the maximum payoff to the firm, but requires that the firm move first before the hacker. Even if a simultaneous game is played, the firm enjoys a higher payoff than that in the decision theory approach, except when the firm's estimate of the hacker effort in the decision theory approach is sufficiently close to the actual hacker effort. We also show that if the firm learns from prior observations of hacker effort and uses these to estimate future hacker effort in the decision theory approach, then the gap between the results of decision theory and game theory approaches diminishes over time. The rate of convergence and the extent of loss the firm suffers before convergence depend on the learning model employed by the firm to estimate hacker effort.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,2,281,304

This information is then used to determine a firm's optimal rate of information technology (IT) outsourcing. We find that the optimal outsourcing rate is dependent on the ability of the outsourcing client to acquire production knowledge from its outsourcing vendor and to retain its internal coordination knowledge despite losses of fundamental production skills due to outsourcing. Specifically, when the client is unable to acquire sufficient production knowledge from the external vendor, the client's optimal outsourcing decision is to engage in either one of two extreme strategies--total insourcing or total outsourcing--depending on the rate at which the client's coordination knowledge depreciates. On the other hand, when the client is able to acquire a substantial amount of production knowledge from the external vendor, the firm's optimal decision is to outsource only a portion of its IT services, where the proportion depends on the rate at which the client's coordination knowledge depreciates.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,147,176

Construct validation of the instrument was conducted using responses from 346 systems users in 149 organizations by a combination of exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling using LISREL. The process resulted in an instrument that measures 18 unidimensional factors within the three ISFS dimensions. Moreover, a sample of 120 matched-paired responses of separate CIO and user responses was used for nomological validation. The results showed that the ISFS measure reflected by the instrument was positively related to improvements in business processes effectiveness and organizational performance.

This study, drawn on sociological theories of embeddedness, addresses this key issue, with particular attention to the perspective of EDI network initiator. Cross-case analysis is conducted comparing three initiators of sophisticated EDI networks, who realized different levels of strategic payoffs. Results reveal that the achievement of strategic payoffs is a function of EDI embeddedness, which is defined as how central or peripheral a specific EDI network is to managing interfirm interdependence. In a model of EDI initiator strategic payoff, the authors argue that EDI embeddedness, which is influenced by existing interfirm relationship, moderates the impact of adopter EDI use on initiator strategic payoff derived from the EDI investment. Specifically, while high embeddedness motivates adopter strategic use, low embeddedness deters such use.

Stock market investors provide one appropriate perspective on the value-creation and growth potential of IT infrastructure investments through their reactions to specific IT infrastructure investment moves by business firms. This research utilizes the event-study analysis approach to examine if IT infrastructure investments are associated with significantly positive abnormal stock market returns and rises in trading volume when firms announce such investments. Drawing upon a sample of IT infrastructure announcements in the early 1990s, this research finds significant evidence that positive abnormal returns and increased trading volume are associated with IT infrastructure investment announcements. Further, when such investments are contrasted with investments in IT applications, evidence exists that infrastructure investments generate greater excess returns and a larger increase in trading volume than applications investments do. The evidence provides empirical support for the potential of IT infrastructure investments to be perceived as a platform for growth and revenue generation opportunities in contemporary business firms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,2,7,42

In TAM, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are hypothesized and empirically supported as fundamental determinants of user acceptance of a given IS/IT.

Data collected from nearly 285 administrative/clerical staff in a large organization were tested against the modified model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results of the study showed that, even though perceived near-term usefulness had the most significant influence on the behavioral intention to use a technology, perceived long-term usefulness also exerted a positive, though lesser, impact. No significant, direct relationship was found between ease of use and behavioral intention to use a technology. Implications of the findings and future research areas are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,2,185,204

This study investigates technology acceptance by individual professionals by examining physicians' decision to accept telemedicine technology. Synthesized from relevant prior research, a generic research framework was built to provide a necessary foundation upon which a research model for telemedicine technology acceptance by physicians could be developed. The research model was then empirically examined, using data collected from more than 400 physicians practicing in public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. Results of the study suggest several areas where individual ""professionals"" might subtly differ in their technology acceptance decision-making, as compared with end users and business managers in ordinary business settings. Specifically, physicians appeared to be fairly pragmatic, largely anchoring their acceptance decisions in the usefulness of the technology rather than its ease of use. When making decisions to accept a technology, physicians expressed considerable concerns about the compatibility of the technology with their practices, placed less importance on controlling technology operations, and attached limited weight to peers' opinions about using the technology. Based on results obtained from this study, the initially proposed framework for technology acceptance by individual professionals was revised to a ""hierarchical, three-layer"" structure with the individual context at the inner core, the implementation context on the outermost layer, and the technological context residing in the middle. Implications for information systems research and telemedicine management practice that have emerged from the study's findings are also discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2002,4,191,229

Raghav Rao,Management of Information Systems Outsourcing: A Bidding Perspective, bidding mechanisms;  information systems management;  mixed integer programming;  outsourcing of information systems,"Outsourcing is the contracting of various information systems' sub- functions by user firms to outside information systems vendors. A critical factor in the outsourcing process is the bidding and vendor selection mechanism. This paper describes the process of outsourcing and identifies the various stages involved. Subsequently, considering that cost reduction is a driving force of outsourcing for user-firms, this paper proposes a bidding mechanism to reduce expected outsourcing costs in the final bidding and vendor selection process. The paper studies outsourcing contracts of routine and repetitive activities such as maintenance and operation of telecommunication networks. A realistic scenario is studied, wherein multiple vendors bid for such contracts and where one vendor has cost and expertise advantages over other vendors and as a result tends to inflate bids. A mixed integer programming model is formulated for a multiple vendor scenario. In general, the results suggest a prescription that calls for the use of ""carrot and stick"" policies by the user firm. Subsidies (the carrot) need to be used as incentives for bidders to announce their most competitive bids. In addition, penalties (the stick) have to be levied in order to pressure bidders not to bid high.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,2,131,159

This paper argues that product competition on the Web is not for generic products but, rather, for expected and augmented product bundles. Our findings point out that even in the absence of price premiums, variance in the ability to after online services can affect pricing strategies and possibly contribute to online price dispersion. We then go on to suggest that online services affect a vendor's customer retention strategy as they influence the design of the augmented product. We characterize an online vendor's selection of augmenting services as a knapsack problem, and recommend that the online vendor should not only periodically reevaluate the set of services offered to satisfy the expected product requirements, but also assess the customer retention ability of his augmented product. A service does not contribute to customer retention when it has either lost its value to the customer or become required as a part of the expected product. Our solution recommends that a vendor should include new services based on the cost-to-value ratio of each service so as to remain above the loyalty threshold of a consumer. The results from our model partially explain the variety in product offerings of many online vendors, whose competency in providing Web-based services allows them to vary the generic product.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,1,355,377

However, due to significantly larger sizes of video files, movies are still largely pirated by duplicating DVDs, VCDs, and other physical media. In the case of DVDs, movie studios have historically maintained different technology codes or formats across various regions of the world, primarily to control the timing of theatrical releases in these parts of the world. This paper formulates an analytical model to study the implications of maintaining different or incompatible technology standards in DVD and other optical disc players on global pricing and piracy of movie discs. Our formulation develops two distinct piracy types, namely, regional and global piracy, signifying if consumers will pirate movies released for their own region or those meant for other regions. Our results find that maintaining separate technology standards is very critical when there is piracy, as losses from global piracy can be higher than when only regional piracy exists. Further, we observe that piracy is not a victimless crime, in that not only do producers suffer losses but consumers in regions with high willingness to pay for quality also stand to lose. In addition, we find that increasing homogeneity in consumer preferences for quality across regions may not be beneficial to digital product vendors unless there is also uniformity in copyright protection laws. We conclude with recommendations for research and practice for movie studios as well as producers for other goods that are dependent on copyright protection such as books and pharmaceuticals.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,2,137,168

Behavioral research suggests that consumers engage in a privacy calculus where they trade off their privacy costs from sharing information against their value from personalization. Through a formal economic model of this personalization-for-privacy (p4p) trade-off, we examine welfare implications by characterizing consumption utilities as ""no-free-disposal"" functions. We investigate the optimality of four regulatory regimes (through allowance/disallowance of usage-enforcing technologies, and private contracts) by analyzing the strategic interaction between a monopolist who offers personalization services ""free of charge"" and two consumer types--privacy and convenience seekers. While many privacy watchdog groups have called for technology restrictions and more regulation, our research broadly suggests that society is better off with assignment of property rights over their information to consumers and full allowance of technological control and contractual abilities for the monopolist. However, when private contracts are proscribed, the regulator should also prevent the deployment of usage-enforcing technologies, particularly when the market is predominantly composed of privacy seekers. Interestingly, unlike traditional price-instrument markets for goods with free disposal, a regulator should not only encourage this market's knowledge of consumers' p4p preferences but also the various uses and benefits of preference information to the vendor.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,193,225

While information sharing is becoming a ubiquitous online phenomenon, how to ensure information quality or induce quality content remains a challenge because of the anonymity of commentators. This paper introduces moderation into reputation systems. We show that moderation directly affects strategic commentators' incentive to generate useful information, and moderation is generally desirable to improve information quality. We find that when being moderated with different probabilities based on their reputations, commentators might display a pattern of reputation oscillation, in which they generate useful content to build up high reputation and then exploit their reputation. As a result, the expected performance from high-reputation commentators can be inferior to that from low-reputation commentators (reverse reputation). We then investigate the optimal moderation resource allocation and conclude that the seemingly abnormal reverse reputation could arise as an optimal result. Our study underscores the importance of moderation and highlights that the frequency of moderation should be properly chosen for better performance of online communities.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,237,268

In both cases, nonmonetary (play money) incentives were utilized, but one market provided additional nonmonetary (play money) incentives. Working with the partner company, our investigation started with seven emerging technologies and expanded to a total of 17 emerging technologies. Our results suggest that even a simple form of additional nonmonetary play money incentive yielded greater price convergence, increased spread across final market prices, and greater consistency with a costly expert panel that was set up by the partner company. Based on the outcomes of our analyses, the partner company is investing in developing extended applications of preference markets as a potentially scalable approach for dealing with its ongoing and expanding strategic identification of promising emerging technologies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,45,70

Companies have begun to explore the possibility of capturing consumers' ""collective intelligence"" by establishing firm-sponsored online brainstorming sites where individuals can share their ideas and offer comments on the ideas contributed by others. We term these sites ""Company-Sponsored Online Co-Creation Brainstorming"" (COCB). The value of this open and voluntary co-creation depends largely on members' contribution levels, the quality of the contributions, and sustained participation. In this paper, utilizing Zwass's taxonomy of co-creation value as a base, we structure a taxonomic framework of COCBs and an accompanying basic model of COCBs. We then present a series of hypotheses concerning the relationships between the model's various factors and specific COCB activities. We validate the model using empirical data collected over two and a half years, starting from the initiation of a pioneering company-sponsored online brainstorming site. Our analyses demonstrate that the level of peer feedback and the responsiveness (speed) of sponsor company feedback have significant influences on both members' contribution levels and duration of active participation. The sponsoring company's feedback, however, seems to influence only the quality of member's contribution level. On the practical side, the outcomes suggest that sponsoring companies should develop efficient processes for reviewing and responding to submitted ideas. Regarding theory, our findings provide an initial piece of contextualized research that offers implications for theory building in the COCB context, most notably the identification of key relationships between feedback (both peer and company) and participant activity levels and duration of participation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,2,141,172

Clicking on icons or command buttons, executives can browse through a series of screens of tabular or graphical information organized in a hierarchical structure. There is, however, no underlying model to guide the navigation of the diverse data and applications used by executives. A repository-based and model-driven EIS that captures integrated organization and information system (IOIS) models of an enterprise is therefore needed. A prototype system, called Repository-based Executive Information System (R-EIS), designed to integrate instead of replacing various existing application systems to support managerial information delivery is presented in this paper. This integrated IOIS model can be used directly by executives to assist them in navigating a model from a business perspective in order to gain access to applications and information to support their decision making. The navigation paths become contexts for the information delivered. Executives who can use an explicit organization model in their navigation of large information bases may learn more about their businesses and therefore facilitate organizational learning.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1995,4,33,63

To deal with these insider issues, this study draws on the compliance theory and the general deterrence theory to propose a research model in which the relations among coercive control, which has been advocated by scholars and widely practiced by companies; remunerative control, which is generally missing in both research and practice; and certainty of control are studied. A Web-based field experiment involving real-world employees in their natural settings was used to empirically test the model. While lending further support to the general deterrence theory, our findings highlight that reward enforcement, a remunerative control mechanism in the information systems security context, could be an alternative for organizations where sanctions do not successfully prevent violation. The significant interactions between punishment and reward found in the study further indicate a need for a more comprehensive enforcement system that should include a reward enforcement scheme through which the organizational moral standards and values are established or reemphasized. The findings of this study can potentially be used to guide the design of more effective security enforcement systems that encompass remunerative control mechanisms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,157,188

Commonly observed policy tools include quotas, tariffs, and subsidies. However, advances in digital technology enable consumers to access digital versions of foreign entertainment programs via the Internet, a leakage channel that bypasses government protection methods. This calls for a reexamination of the effectiveness of these traditional tools. We build a unified analytical framework to study the impact of digital technology on cultural protection policies. We find that in the presence of Internet leakage, imposing a quota is the least effective protection policy to maximize the total domestic social welfare, but using either a tariff or subsidy policy is optimal, depending on the quality difference between domestic and foreign entertainment programs via the traditional channel and the Internet. Using quotas remains the least effective policy when we extend the analyses to consider the presence of piracy. In addition to the quality difference between foreign and domestic entertainment, the proportion of unethical consumers and the cost of piracy determine whether using tariffs or subsidies is the optimal policy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,269,302

We investigate the competing OSS and proprietary software products with comparable functionalities in four different scenarios depending on whether they are compatible with each other and whether the underlying market is fully covered (i.e., all consumers adopt one of the two products). Furthermore, we study which party has the most incentive to make its product compatible with its counterpart. When the market is fully covered, the installed base and the profit of proprietary software increase at the expense of a decreasing user base for OSS in the presence of network externalities. This competitive imbalance becomes more pronounced when OSS and proprietary software are incompatible and the market is partially covered. Finally, we find that in the presence of network externalities, being compatible with its rival is not desirable for the proprietary software, but highly beneficial to the OSS community.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,201,230

The first step, based on some field observations, resulted in a descriptive profiling of the EUC strategies via the management attributes of policy setting and planning, support, and control. The second step produced a prescriptive timing with respect to the phases of EUC strategy evolution. The integrative framework that resulted from this two-step process was based on the premise that EUC technology adoption follows a learning curve phenomenon. In essence, such a framework should serve as a tool, useful to the practitioner in coping with the dynamic environment surrounding the management of end-user computing.",Journal of Management Information Systems,4,1987,3,28,49

Group development is based on the fact that most groups have a past and a future, and this affects group outcomes. However, most GDSS studies have investigated only a single group session. This study examined the behavior of groups using a GDSS over multiple sessions. The study reported in this paper specifically examined the following two questions: (1) does computer support affect the development of decision-making groups? and (2) do the patterns of development differ over time between computer-supported and manual groups? These two questions were studied using a two-factorial repeated measures research design. Results showed significant differences in development patterns between computer-supported groups and manual groups in terms of conflict management and degree of cohesiveness. After adapting to GDSS, computer-supported groups displayed more productive conflict management and higher group cohesiveness than manual groups.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,3,7,25

Building upon their previous research in automatic concept generation and classification, they demonstrated that the Kohonen SOM was able to perform concept clustering effectively, based on its concept precision and recall 7 scores as judged by human experts.

In general, word mismatch refers to the phenomenon in which a concept is described by different terms in user queries and in source documents. Query expansion represents a promising avenue to address such problems. Previous research predominantly approaches query expansion on the basis of global or local analysis. However, these approaches emphasize a global perspective rather than taking a topic-specific view of term associations. As a consequence, their effectiveness can be severely constrained when the document corpus spans a diverse set of topics. In this study, we propose a topic-based approach for query expansion and develop and empirically evaluate two novel methods--namely, nonfuzzy and fuzzy topic-based query expansion--to address word mismatch problems. According to our evaluation results, the proposed topic-based approach is more effective than a benchmark global analysis method, particularly when user queries consist of multiple query terms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,269,295

Yet stress/strain among software developers has been steadily increasing and is at an all-time high, while their productivity is often questioned. Why, if these innovations are meant to improve the environment, are developers more stressed and less productive than they should be? Using a combination of cognitive style and person-environment fit theories as the theoretical lens. this study examines one potential source of stress/strain and productivity impediment among software developers. Specifically, this paper examines the fit between the preferred cognitive style of a software developer and his or her perception of the cognitive style required by the job environment, and the effect of that fit on stress/strain and performance. Data collected from a field study of 123 (object-oriented) software developers suggest that performance decreases and stress increases as this gap between cognitive styles becomes wider. Using surface response methodology, the precise fit relationship is modeled. The interaction of the developer and the environment provides explanatory power above and beyond either of the factors separately, suggesting that studies examining strain and performance of developers should explicitly consider and measure the cognitive style fit between the software developer and the software development environment. In practice, managers can use the results to help recognize misfit, its consequences, and the appropriate interventions (such as training or person/task matching).",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,193,226

As with any new information technology (IT), the decision to adopt SOA cannot be taken lightly, given the nontrivial investment in economic and personnel resources. The complexity associated with industry-wide diffusion, coupled with organization, industry, and environment factors, contributes to a lack of a clear strategy for assessing the business value that SOA provides an organization. This research attempts to shed light on this process of value creation for an organization, using a system dynamics approach. A detailed model of the industry diffusion coupled with organization adoption is presented. After suitable calibration and validation, a series of simulations using the model evaluate the efficacy of SOA under a variety of diverse conditions. The results of the simulations indicate clear benefits of SOA over monolithic ITs when employed under appropriate conditions. Situations where SOA fails to live up to expectations are also identified. The model and accompanying simulations can serve as a practical decision support tool for an organization to help make the strategic decisions of adopting and implementing SOA.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2010,4,253,286

Very few have used case-based reasoning, where cases of conceptual design are stored, indexed, and used for future designs. Furthermore, there is a general lack of reported research on validating and verifying such systems. In this paper, we describe our approach in using case-based reasoning for conceptual data-base design. To test and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and its theoretical foundation, two prototype systems were constructed. In the absence of existing matching conceptual design constructs, the first system uses first principles of conceptual design to assist a human designer in arriving at a design for a new problem. In contrast, the second system uses constructs from previously stored design cases. The two are tightly integrated. A novel approach in structuring the case base was developed. Unique aspects of the case-base architecture and its learning mechanism are described. In order to measure user preference, an experiment was designed and conducted. Findings indicate that reuse of schemata not only is preferred by the users over the design from the first principles, but also results in fewer errors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,281,314

One such methodology is a lens model analysis. The authors used such a model to study how well a model of expert decisions can capture a valid strategy in the decision process. The study also addresses whether a model of an expert can be more accurate than the expert. The predictive accuracy (predictive validity) of two linear (statistical) models and two nonlinear models of human experts is compared. The results indicate that nonlinear models can capture factors (valid nonlinear strategy) that contribute to the experts' predictive accuracy. However, linear models cannot capture the valid nonlinear strategy as well as nonlinear models. One linear model and two nonlinear models performed as well as the overall average of a group of experts. However, all of the models were outperformed by the most accurate expert. By combining validity of decision strategy with characteristics of modeling algorithms, it is possible to explain why certain algorithms perform better than others.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,1,189,206

End-User Computing (EUC) is a rapidly growing phenomenon in organizations. EUC will soon be a major segment of information systems in most large organizations. There is a growing concern about the potential organizational risks of EUC activities.Generic controls are then identified that address each of the risks enumerated in the article. Controls are introduced in a manner that allows EUC management to select those most appropriate to their EUC environment.,Journal of Management Information Systems,2,1985,3,5,20

There are several differences between SaaS and perpetual licensing. SaaS licensing offers software using a subscription model, whereas perpetual licensing involves a one-time payment for a perpetual use license and optional additional payments for future upgrades. Prior literature has not considered the impact of these licensing schemes on the publisher's incentive to invest in software quality. We model differences in how new software features are disseminated in SaaS and perpetual licensing. We show that these differences affect the publisher's incentive to invest in product development. We find that the SaaS licensing model leads to greater investment in product development under most conditions. This increased investment leads to higher software quality in equilibrium under SaaS as compared to perpetual licensing. The software publisher earns greater profits and social welfare is higher under SaaS under these conditions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,2,141,165

To analyze this question, we consider an IT department that procures IT services from a cloud computing vendor and enhances these services for consuming units within the firm. Our model incorporates the competitive environment faced by the cloud vendor, which affects the price of the cloud vendor. We find that when the cloud vendor faces intense competition, the cost-center organizational model is preferred over the profit-center model. Infrastructure services such as basic storage, e-mail, and raw computing face intense competition, and our results suggest that such services be offered as a free corporate resource under the cost-center organizational structure. When the cloud vendor has pricing power, a profit-center organizational structure is likely to be preferred. Our results suggest that highly differentiated services such as cloud-based enterprise-wide enterprise resource planning or business intelligence be offered under the profit-center structure. Finally, the profit-center structure provides greater internal quality enhancement to cloud-based IT services than the cost center.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,2,67,100

In this paper, we investigate the combined use of self-organizing maps (SOM) and nonsmooth nonconvex optimization techniques in order to produce a working case of a data-driven risk classification system. The optimization approach strengthens the validity of SOM results, and the improved classification system increases both the quality of prediction and the homogeneity within the risk groups. Accurate classification of prostate cancer patients into risk groups is important to assist in the identification of appropriate treatment paths. We start with the existing rules and aim to improve classification accuracy by identifying inconsistencies utilizing self-organizing maps as a data visualization tool. Then, we progress to the study of assigning prostate cancer patients into homogenous groups with the aim to support future clinical treatment decisions. Using the case of prostate cancer patients grouping, we demonstrate strong potential of data-driven risk classification schemes for addressing the risk grouping issues in more general organizational settings.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2005,4,85,100

Girard had introduced George, the first major ATM offering in Philadelphia, and hoped it would provide competitive advantage in retail banking; PNB used MAC to counter this threat. Despite Girard's scale advantage and first-mover effects, PNB was able to attract enough banks to MAC for MAC to dominate and eventually merge with or acquire all other ATM networks in Pennsylvania. Several factors explain why PNB succeeded with MAC, and why the ownership structure of MAC is unique among the major shared ATM networks in the U.S. Among these, timing is keyâ€”MAC emerged before the other shared ATM networks, and before the critical importance of ATM service was evident. Contrasting the structure of ATM networks with other electronic distribution channels, and comparing the profitability of providing each, offers valuable insight into the power associated with the channel provider under different conditions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,1,5,25

The well-known ""market for lemons"" phenomenon studied by Akerlof, and the even older Gresham's law effect, are contributing to loss of buyers' confidence in eBay, shrinking sellers' margins, contributing to the erosion of eBay's share price, and, potentially, leading to serious reductions in the value of eBay as an electronic auction site. buySAFE has created an alternative mechanism for reducing buyers' information deficit concerning sellers and their merchandise, involving a third-party certification system and bonding for qualified sellers; the rating is analogous to bond rating services such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Analysis of buySAFE's certification and bonding strategies for eBay sellers provides a basis for ongoing theory development related to organizational strategies that recognize the importance of information asymmetries in the digital marketplace and address resolution of consumers' concerns. buySAFE's original business model involves bonding sellers' transactions and protecting consumers for as much as $25,000. This has a number of beneficial effects on the buyers and sellers: it improves the information endowments of the buyers, it increases their willingness to pay for the goods and services offered, and it increases the margins and total revenues of the sellers. Although acceptance of buySAFE has been rapid, it has been slower than anticipated, and slower than theory would suggest. The company's executives are exploring adjusting their approach to the market and finding a way to achieve higher profitability, and working to limit their dependence upon eBay.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,2,43,71

A system dynamics model of the software development process is employed as our experimentation vehicle. In addition to permitting less costly and less time-consuming experimentation, simulation-type models can provide useful insights into the causes behind the different behavior patterns observed. Our results indicate that staff turnover, acquisition, and assimilation rates can increase a project's cost and duration, by as much as 40 to 60 percent. This suggests that the three staffing variables are indeed critical for the successful development of software systems, as well as for the accurate estimation of software development cost and schedule.",Journal of Management Information Systems,6,1989,1,21,40

This informedness has altered the demand side of market behavior: customers now discount more heavily when comparable products are available from competitors and when products do not meet their wants, needs, cravings, and longings, but they no longer discount as heavily when purchasing unfamiliar products. Changes in the demand side are producing comparable changes in the supply side: firms earn less than their expectations when competing in traditional mass-market fat spots, while earning far more than previously when entering newly created resonance marketing sweet spots. We trace the impact of hyperdifferentiation and resonance marketing on strategy, with a clear progression from a limited number of fat spots, through reliance on line extensions, and ultimately to fully differentiated market sweet spots.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,2,13,40

Most are either some form of consumer-focused advertising or of consumer-focused e-commerce. And yet the Net is far more powerful than traditional media on one hand, and far more liberating and thus inappropriate as an alternative to traditional media on the other. There are numerous potential online business models that are not based on advertising. This paper explores several such areas and divides them into two basic categories, those that sell some product, experience, content, or service and earn revenues from the sale, and those that provide access to consumers and charge for access. It further divides each of these major categories into subcategories, and for each subcategory reviews current experience, places it in the context of the relevant literature in competitive strategy, and uses that theory to make predictions. The paper concludes with strategic recommendations for corporations as well as with suggestions for further research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,15,41

Bin,Justifying Contingent Information Technology Investments: Balancing the Need for Speed of Action with Certainty Before Action, information technology investment;  option valuation;  strategic investments;  strategic options,"Executives need to master different mechanisms for analyzing their firms' investment opportunities in uncertain, difficult times. Rapidly changing business conditions require firms to move quickly, with total commitment and the rapid deployment of capital, resources, and management attention, often in several directions at the same time. However, high levels of strategic uncertainty and environmental risk, combined with limits on available funding, require firms to limit their commitment. In brief, we require high levels of strategic commitment to numerous projects, while simultaneously preserving our flexibility and withholding commitment. Whereas achieving both is clearly impossible, techniques exist that enable executives (1) to identify and to delimit their range of investment alternatives that must be considered, and to do so rapidly and reliably, (2) to divide investments into discrete stages that can be implemented sequentially, (3) to determine which chunks can safely and profitably be developed as strategic options, with value that can be captured when subsequent stage investments are made later; and (4) to quantify and to estimate the value of these strategic options with a significant degree of accuracy, so that selections can be made from a portfolio of investment alternatives. This paper also avoids restrictions of common option valuation models by providing a technique that is general enough to be used when the data required by common models are not available or the assumptions are not satisfied.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,2,11,48

In many markets, dominant players have pursued pricing and service policies that, although once highly effective, now make their markets attractive targets for aggressive new entrants. The entrants' strategies rely on lower overhead costs, new technologies, alternative distribution channels, and the active targeting of profitable customers. Several factors will make it possible for entrants to attack dominant players; simplistic historical pricing mistakes or policies of promising or providing universal service will make it attractive for new entrants to attack. Restrictions on the flexibility of incumbents--both externally and internally imposed--may make it difficult for dominant players to defend themselves effectively against attack by more flexible entrants with cream-skimming strategies and newer technology. We develop a set of alternatives for incumbent firms facing increasing ""contestability"" in their markets and the threat of agile entrants.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,2,59,75

Hyperdifferentiation says that firms can now produce almost anything that appeals to consumers and they can manage the complexity of the increasingly diverse product portfolios that result. Resonance marketing says that informed consumers will purchase products that they actually truly want. When consumers become more informed, firms that provide highly differentiated products should experience higher growth rates than firms with less differentiated offerings. We construct measures of product positioning based on online ratings and find supportive evidence using sales data from the craft beer industry. In particular, we find that the variance of ratings and the strength of the most positive quartile of reviews play a significant role in determining which new products grow fastest in the marketplace. This supports our expectations for resonance marketing.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,2,149,171

We examine what resources have previously enabled record companies to lock in their star acts and ways in which technology has altered artists' abilities to reach the market independently and thus their dependency upon record companies. We examine which resources have seen their value eroded in the newspaper industry and the remaining value that the newspaper company still creates, other than building stories, adding advertising, and printing and selling the papers. We consider what part of the newspaper business is vulnerable, if any, and where threats may arise. We combine the resource-based view of competitive advantage to examine which industry may have become newly easy to enter, and the theory of newly vulnerable markets to assess which industry may actually have become vulnerable as a result. Our analyses are then used to create a computer simulation model to make the implications more explicit under a range of assumptions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,17,41

Here, the authors analyze how Rosenbluth International, one of the largest travel agencies, was able to accomplish that. Threatened with disintemediation during the period of drastic restructuring of travel brokerage, the company strategically revised its value proposition. It has divested itself of its leisure travel segment and offered a range of its services on a fee basis to its customers, rather than rely on commissions by the suppliers of travel services, as it had done previously. This strategic change was enabled by information systems, several of them highly innovative, which Rosenbluth had used strategically in its prior business initiatives.

We argue that this form of transactional risk, a component of transaction costs, is increasingly important in our service-centered, information-driven, postindustrial economy. Using case examples and a discussion of the related literature, we demonstrate and discuss the conditions under which shared information creates the potential for poaching, examine the impact and efficacy of traditional remedies for contractual problems in managing poaching, and identify additional mechanisms for managing poaching risk. Our analysis suggests that these risks and their remedies are fundamentally different in nature from those considered in previous theories of supplier relations and contractual governance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,2,87,107

Regulatory policies that were developed in response to nineteenth- or twentieth-century antitrust concerns dealt principally with economies of scale leading to monopoly power and may not be well suited to the issues of network effects or third-party payer online business models such as sponsored search. From the perspective of information systems economics, we investigate if such third-party payer digital systems require intervention as profound as the government's innovative approach to the problems posed by AT&T; in the 1913 Kingsbury Commitment, establishing the first private regulated monopoly. Google provides an example of a company whose innovative digital business model is difficult to fit into current regulatory frameworks, and may provide examples of the issues that might require an extension to regulatory policy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,43,80

Row,"The Impact of Information Technology on the Organization of Economic Activity: The ""Move to the Middle"" Hypothesis", interorganizational systems;  interorganizational coordination;  market governance;  outsourcing,"Investments to increase the level of explicit coordination with outside agents have generally resulted in increased risk to the firm; firms have traditionally avoided this increased risk by becoming vertically integrated or by underinvesting in coordination. This paper argues that information technology (IT) has the ability to lower coordination cost without increasing the associated transactions risk, leading to more outsourcing and less vertically integrated firms. Lower relationship-specificity of IT investments and a better monitoring capability imply that firms can more safely invest in information technology for interfirm coordination than in traditional investments for explicit coordination such as co-located facilities or specialized human resources; firms are therefore more likely to coordinate with suppliers without requiring ownership to reduce their risk. This enables them to benefit from production economies of large specialized suppliers. Moreover, rapid reduction in the cost of IT and reduction in the transactions risk of explicit coordination makes possible substantially more use of explicit coordination with suppliers. The resulting transaction economies of scale, learning curve effects, and other factors favor a move toward long-term relationships with a smaller set of suppliers. We call this combination--a move to more outsourcing, but from a reduced set of stable partnerships--the ""move to the middle"" hypothesis.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,2,9,35

We analyze firm-level panel data covering the period 1987â€“2008 using fixed effects and first differencing, standard methods that account for unobservable firm-level effects. We find that return on assets drops significantly during the project initiation year. According to fixed effects results, the performance and productivity measures improve in a decreasing manner after project initiation, suggesting that BPR indeed positively affects firm performance on average. We also find that enterprise-wide BPR projects are associated with more negative returns during project initiation than functionally focused projects. However, there is no clear evidence regarding their superiority over functionally focused BPR projects in terms of performance improvements after project initiation, perhaps because grand projects are risky and sometimes lead to grand failures.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,129,162

Their strategy was based on exploiting the structural changes initiated by airline deregulation in 1978, including growth of the corporate travel market and increasing economies of scale leading to consolidation. Information technology (IT) was a fundamental part of this strategy. The case sheds light on several theories on gaining competitive advantage through IT; these theories feature technology leadership, leveraging critical resources, the role of IT infrastructure, and switching costs. While these theories contribute to an explanation of Rosenbluth's success, a critical factor appears to be the vision to see an opportunity and the ability to hustle to exploit it.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,2,53,79

The resulting emergence of new forms of organizational relationships is challenging managers to understand the fundamental dynamics of cooperation in order to evaluate and restructure their industrial relationships. This paper applies transactions cost economics toward understanding cooperative relationships. Cooperation is viewed as an effort to increase resource utilization and value through higher explicit coordination of economic activities. However, increasing explicit coordination can create transaction risks: exposure to opportunistic behavior by the other party. Transaction risk limits the level of coordination that is achievable. Information technology can reduce the costs of coordination while also reducing the transaction risks associated with increased coordination. These dual effects suggest a move toward tightly coupled, cooperative relationships.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,2,9,28

However, improved coordination through IT, and the economic benefits from that coordination, may not be fully realized in practice; this conclusion is suggested by a field study in the consumer packaged goods industry investigating the impact of IT on interactions between manufacturers and retailers. New coordination mechanisms are emerging, driven by checkout scanner systems and IT, that permit more tightly coupled logistics operations in the distribution channel. The potential benefits of this increased coordination, through reduction in inventory and more stable manufacturing, are dramatic. However, we have observed considerable resistance by retailers to these innovations. Analysis of our field study results suggests that this resistance is due to the impact of the new coordination mechanisms on bargaining power; retailers perceive that their bargaining power will be eroded under the new coordination structure, and fear that this will preclude their sharing in the economic benefits.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,1,73,95

Our research suggests that the two principal reasons for failure are functionality risk and political risk: respectively, the organization's inability to understand its uncertain future strategic needs, and its inability to make painful and difficult changes in response to these future strategic needs. Recent research in the organizational change literature suggests that these risks are the result of conflict among the organization's current strategy, its espoused degree of change, the actually accepted and generally smaller degree of change, and the generally larger degree of change that would be in some sense optimal. Moreover, the conflicts among these may be unperceived or undiscussable within the organization, exacerbating the risks. We summarize in a few testable hypotheses our experience with managing the risks of reengineering, and use a small set of representative case studies to examine these hypotheses informally.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,2,9,36
465, Eric K. Clemons;  Matt E. Thatcher,Evaluating Alternative Information Regimes in the Private Health Insurance Industry: Managing the Social Cost of Private Information, adverse selection;  information asymmetry;  information economics;  insurance regulation,"This paper addresses the cost imposed on an insurance market when individual applicants possess an information advantage over the insurers; in short, we examine the social cost of private information. When consumers differ significantly in terms of their riskiness, and their insurance companies cannot, or are not permitted to assess these differences, insurance companies will attempt to charge all consumers the same premiums for equivalent coverage; unless mechanisms can be designed to allow consumers to signal accurately and credibly their private assessments of their own riskiness, low-risk consumers will consider that they are being overcharged and many will drop out of the market. These consumers, who wish to buy insurance--albeit at a lower price--but who are not now insured, represent a loss of social welfare. As information asymmetries increase, more consumers determine that they are being overcharged, increasing the loss of social welfare. This paper addresses minimizing the loss of social welfare, or maximizing the extent to which the population is insured, in the presence of extremely different consumer risk profiles by examining plausible pricing and policy designs, in order to assess which design minimizes decreases in consumer participation in the insurance market. While unable to make selections among information regimes, which entail a wide range of complex and subjective social choices, the paper does make clear comparisons of alternative designs within each information regime.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,2,9,31

Intelligence is supplied from the interface and from the planner, as well as from the domain knowledge. An important component of the domain knowledge is the functional structure which captures activity relationships with a uniform representation scheme. Users can access explanations about functions of the office and can add comments on them. The realization of these concepts in a prototype system is discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,1,133,163

Weber,Strategic Information Technology Investments: Guidelines for Decision Making, information systems for competitive advantage;  investment in information systems;  risk assessment for information system projects,"As the strategic importance of information technology (IT) has increased, the decision of where and when to allocate resources to IT programs has become more risky and more difficult. Executives are tempted by the opportunities for strategic impact, but struggle with the massive expenditures and uncertainties involved. Evaluating the opportunity afforded by a system and judging its strategic impact in advance have proven difficult, and even when analyses are performed well, they are frequently done on an ad hoc basis. IT can confer advantage under appropriate conditions, and equally important, even when it fails to confer advantage, it may still prove crucial. Both concepts--competitive advantage and strategic necessity--confound traditional financial analysis. We offer seven principles on which to base an evaluation of a strategic IT venture. Although we have not performed a statistically validating study, these principles are expressed as guidelines we believe to be true, based on experience. The guidelines range from modeling the investment decision, through managing risk, to preparing for unanticipated upside and downside implications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,2,9,28

Numerous changes occurred simultaneously, including elimination of fixed brokerage commissions, a marked increase in the number of market participants, changes in the structure and ownership of trading firms, and, perhaps most importantly, swift movement of securities trading away from the floor of the Exchange, This remains the most rapid and complete regulatory reform of any market, and the most striking example to date of a regulatory event engineered to benefit the local financial industry. The transformation was accomplished in large part through the Exchange's implementation of a screen-based dealing system. Since the overhaul of its established securities trading practices, London's financial markets have undergone profound change while continuing to operate smoothly; a number of benefits have been realized.",Journal of Management Information Systems,6,1990,4,41,60
469, Eric K. Clemons;  Bruce W. Weber,"Segmentation, Differentiation, and Flexible Pricing: Experiences with Information Technology and Segment-Tailored Strategies", flexible pricing;  market segmentation;  value of information,"Information technology (IT) radically alters the cost of capturing, storing, and analyzing information, and thus dramatically alters the value of the historical data represented by a firm's detailed transaction records of customer interactions. Yet, information systems are seldom used to their full potential in developing flexible pricing strategies and tailored offerings for individual customers, based either on the actual cost of serving these customers or on their demonstrated preferences and requirements. This will become increasingly crucial in industries with heterogeneous customers and with costs that vary widely across customers, in order to enable flexible pricing and to provide services that are accurately targeted at the needs of specific customer segments. In addition, accurate, detailed, and robust cost-accounting systems and expertise in the interpretation of performance data will increasingly become essential for competing successfully; those firms prevented from accurate microsegmentation by corporate culture and tradition, by regulation, or by an outmoded information infrastructure will be vulnerable to newer and more nimble competitors. In particular, being the low-cost provider with economies of scale will not provide adequate defense against targeted cream-skimming by opportunistic competitors, able to offer lower prices to selected customer segments. The earliest academic papers on the strategic implications of information technology explicitly adopted a framework recommending that firms adopt a single, simple generic strategy from a small set (cost leadership, differentiation, or niche). In contrast, recent experience suggests that IT may enable firms to select from more finely tuned strategic options, arid that it may require them to implement multiple strategies simultaneously.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,2,9,36

Information technology has had a number of significant impacts on financial markets, enabling enormous increases in volumes and more sophisticated trading techniques, such as program trading and index arbitrage. Despite improvements, some large institutional investors identify shortcomings in today's markets that make the process of buying or selling large, block orders time-consuming and costly. To address these concerns, a new trading system, OptiMark, has been built around several innovations, including (1) a graphical user front end for depicting trading preferences, and (2) a back end built on high-performance computers that process expressions of trading interest according to a price-setting algorithm intended to achieve superior outcomes for traders. OptiMark provides a means for more cost-effective block trading and is expected to contribute to regulatory objectives. This paper details the operations of OptiMark, examines its adoption potential, and assesses the impact it may have on block trading, broker-dealer intermediaries, and the equities markets.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,2,41,60

Current support technologies for prototyping environments are typically intended to increase the efficiency of the individual system builder. We propose a broader perspective for assessing the impact of support technology on prototyping processes. In developing this perspective, we present frameworks for prototyping processes, support technologies, and development performance. Prototyping is characterized from the behavioral perspectives of individual, social, and organizational processes--each of which must be considered in assessing impacts. Support technology is characterized by production, coordination, and organizational dimensions, each affecting prototyping processes and performance in unique ways. To assess the impacts of the process-technology linkages, measures are suggested for evaluating prototyping processes and products from task, social, and business perspectives. It is proposed that the primary determinant of performance impact is the fit between the prototyping processes and the support technology used. By combining a functional model of support technology with behavioral perspectives of the prototyping process, a better understanding of the impacts of technology on prototyping effectiveness is obtained.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,3,67,87

This paper presents a qualitative study of role changes that occur when faculty become online or ""virtual"" professors. In 20 semi-structured interviews of faculty, coded with pattern analysis software, the authors captured role changes enacted by instructors in ALN settings--cognitive roles, affective roles, and managerial roles. The cognitive role, which relates to mental processes of learning, information storage, and thinking, shifts to one of deeper cognitive complexity. The affective role, which relates to influencing the relationships between students, the instructor, and the classroom atmosphere, required faculty to find new tools to express emotion, yet they found the relationships with students more intimate. The managerial role, which deals with class and course management, requires grater attention to detail, more structure, and additional student monitoring. Overall, faculty reported a change in their teaching persona, toward more precision in their presentation of materials and instruction, combined with a shift to a more Socratic pedagogy, emphasizing multilogues with students. The main sources of frustration and of fulfillment of the virtual professor is explored.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2002,4,169,189

To test the hypotheses, a survey-based field study was conducted in forty large organizations with a total of 506 usable responses. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) multivariate path analysis statistical technique. The preliminary empirical evidence provides general support for most of the key relationships contained in the model. Both the model based on the original sample and the validation of that model, based on the holdback sample, had good overall fits to the data. Of the important contributions, the end-users' motivation to develop new applications was found to be the most significant, showing the strongest positive path coefficient with application utilization. Perceived organizational support of EUC was found to be indirectly related to improved end-user information satisfaction and application utilization. Given a limited set of organizational resources, we suggest that managers invest time and money in improving organizational support of EUC where the immediate payoff may not be readily evident.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,1,63,89

Our analysis of the attacker--defender interaction shows that well-protected targets can use signals of their superior level of protection as a deterrence tool. This is due to the fact that, all other things being equal, rational attackers motivated by potential financial gains tend to direct their effort toward less-protected targets. We analyze several scenarios differing in the scope of publicly available information about target parameters and discuss conditions under which greater defenders' ability to signal their security characteristics may improve their welfare. Our results may assist security researchers in devising better defense strategies through the use of deterrence and provide new insight about the efficacy of specific security practices in complex information security environments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,241,274

Locking protocols are the most prominent and widely used of these techniques, with two-phase locking and tree locking being but two examples of these protocols. A locking protocol defines a general set of restrictions on the placement of lock and unlock steps within transactions. In this paper we show that it is possible to further increase the potential level of concurrency of a set of transactions, within the context of a specific locking protocol, by further restricting the placement of lock and unlock steps within each transaction. We also discuss a variation of the tree locking protocols that allows transactions to be locked with respect to a dynamically changing set of tree structures. In addition, we define and discuss the concept of a concurrency cost function for a locked transaction. This cost function measures the potential for conflict of a transaction with other transactions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,4,1987,2,74,92

In the current investigation, three components of Web site design (information design, navigation design, and visual design) are considered for their impact on trust and satisfaction. In turn, relationships of trust and satisfaction to online loyalty are evaluated. Utilizing data collected from 571 participants in Canada, Germany, and China, various relationships in the research model are tested using partial least squares analysis for each country separately. In addition, the overall model is tested for all countries combined as a control and verification of earlier research findings, although this time with a mixed country sample. All paths in the overall model are confirmed. Differences are determined for separate country samples concerning whether navigation design, visual design, and information design result in trust, satisfaction, and ultimately loyalty--suggesting design characteristics should be a central consideration in Web site design across cultures.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2008,4,47,72

The adoption of e-sourcing, defined as the use of business software (for example, using application service providers to conduct online procurement auctions) to automate or augment the aforementioned key business process, has been growing rapidly in recent years. One often-cited benefit of e-sourcing is the predicted savings, which is appealing, given the increasing pressure on cost competitiveness faced by firms. Using queuing techniques, this paper develops an economic model that captures fundamental trade-offs in a firm's e-sourcing business process as characterized by communication complexity, frequency of use, and cost of delay. This allows comparisons of two widely adopted structures for e-sourcing; the centralized structure versus the decentralized structure. Conditions under which the centralized structure is favored over the decentralized structure and vice versa are identified and illustrated with numerical examples and case evidence. These findings are robust in other settings. The paper concludes with a discussion of managerial implications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,141,164

The classification performance of the neural network models was compared to that of a statistical method. The results indicate that one of the ANN models, namely the simple recurrent network, was a superior classifier for this behavior-based problem. In addition, the uncertainty inherent in such classification decisions was examined with a loss matrix, and the holdout samples were reclassified using a loss matrix.

They develop the idea that complementary assets (especially business process design and human capital) influence the firm's realization of value, using concepts such as locus of value and value conversion contingencies. Expanding beyond earlier process models of IT value, which begin with IT expenditure, their analysis of IT value emphasizes the consideration of potential value for an IT investment both in ex ante project selection, and ex post investment evaluation.

Organizations expend considerable effort to reduce opportunism. Agency theory espouses formal contracts as effective constraints on opportunism; however, a consultant's use of tacit knowledge subjects clients to information asymmetry that is not amenable to formal contracts. The principal-professional lens was developed to accommodate the presence of tacit knowledge, but it ignores formal contracts and, like agency theory, ignores the existence of principal opportunism. This examination of information systems (IS) consulting notes that when information asymmetry is present, both clients and consultants sometimes behave opportunistically. The level of information asymmetry, the type of knowledge, and the level of contract specificity in an IS consulting engagement determine the mixture of legal and social constraints that are efficacious. Based on these revelations and the inadequacy of other theories, a theoretical model of relationship constraints is developed to explain the interplay between signaling and screening, knowledge type, contract specificity, and the levels of information asymmetry in predicting adopted constraint mechanisms. For researchers, this new model offers a lens to study opportunism from a knowledge-based perspective, whereas for practitioners it offers the possibility of forestalling a decline in markets due to rampant opportunism.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,143,178

The electronic channel has the advantage of reduced search cost and its reach is increasing, but it has limited capability to provide product information. This paper examines how Internet technology affects a monopoly manufacturer's distribution problem in an environment where product information is important for consumers to identify their ideal product. The model suggests that a manufacturer uses the electronic channel in addition to the physical channel when the product information is very valuable and product information is largely about digital attributes, or when the product information is not valuable. The model also suggests that when the manufacturer chooses to sell through both channels, there is an increase in price competition between the two channels such that the manufacturer need not sell through the electronic retailer with the highest reach. Also, when a large proportion of consumers have access to both channels, the manufacturer may sell through only one channel. The paper also examines the case where the manufacturer operates in the electronic channel and the case where the retailers are integrated.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,167,198
498, Prabuddha De;  Hsu Cheng,Adaptive Information Systems Control: A Reliability-based Approach, information systems management;  database evolution;  system reliability,"The problem of information systems control is well known to information managers, but its scientific nature has not been studied thoroughly. The literature of information systems (IS) has been concerned mostly with such problems as IS policies and system development methodologies. Relatively few attempts have been made to solve the problem of adapting an ongoing IS in a systematic fashion. This adaptation problem, however, is critical in is management since an IS is really an evolving structure rather than a stable, one-shot phenomenon. Toward this end, this article develops a framework for general systems control using a reliability-based approach and characterizes the IS control problem accordingly. Then, an adaptive control construct is proposed for systematic evolution of an IS over time. Both users' satisfaction with the IS and the usage pattern are monitored on a real-time basis and used for controlling the IS adaptively. Chance-constrained models are proposed to characterize suitable decision rules. Some model scenarios demonstrating the feasibility of the approach are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,3,1986,2,33,51

Knowledge acquisition/capture, the first step in knowledge management, continues to be a bottleneck and is exacerbated when experts are geographically distributed. Furthermore, knowledge from multiple experts is likely to generate inconsistent knowledge for a given problem domain. There is thus a compelling need to generate consensus by resolving inconsistencies and conflicts that may occur among experts during the process of knowledge acquisition. This process is more challenging when dealing with virtual teams of experts. This study addresses task-based or cognitive conflicts among experts. A key objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two cognitive techniques-the repertory grid (or RepGrid) and Delphi-in generating consensus among experts during the knowledge capture process. A field experiment with geographically distributed real-world network experts involving multiple rounds of interaction over an extended period of time was conducted. Findings from this research indicate that, in the short run, Delphi works better than the RepGrid in reducing conflict and generating consensus. However, the RepGrid technique appears to perform better in the long run. We find similar results for satisfaction with the process and outcome. Our findings also indicate that experts using the RepGrid technique elicited more knowledge as well as higher-quality knowledge than experts using the Delphi technique. To sum up, our study indicates that RepGrid is superior to Delphi, and therefore managers should seriously consider the use of RepGrid in capturing knowledge from multiple and distributed experts when dealing with complex real-world issues.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,311,350

Issues for further research concern the development of a collaborative modeling environment that allows for group enabled model construction and viewing and the automatic transformation between different types of models.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,3,141,164

Although the state of knowledge and theory development in this area warrants a focus on descriptive field explorations, most cross-cultural GSS research has taken place in laboratory environments. The study reported here represents the first detailed descriptive field study of GSS application in Africa. A grounded theory approach was used to collect and analyze data on eleven projects in which GSS meetings were organized in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. From the data emerged a model of GSS acceptance in the cultures investigated that extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in terms of a specification of a number of relevant external factors. These factors include the endorsement of top management, computer literacy, oral communication preference, referent power, and satisfaction with use. Furthermore, the findings suggest that there is potential for applying GSS in Africa to support capacity-building efforts, which tops the agenda of international development agencies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,3,197,234

Redefined models become the blueprints for improved business activities. The cost to produce models of the organization is high and model accuracy is important. Involvement from knowledgeable participants and stakeholders is desirable during business modeling and analysis. Traditional modeling approaches limit direct participation to a small handful of participants. This paper discusses the development and evaluation of an electronic meeting system (EMS) based activity modeling tool. Modeling efforts supported by this new approach are compared with modeling efforts supported by analysts with a single-user tool. The results of this comparison reveal that the EMS-based modeling tool allows a greater number of individuals to participate efficiently in model development. Models are developed between 175 percent and 251 percent faster with the new approach than with the traditional approach. Specific features are discussed that help relatively novice modelers work with analysts to develop models of reasonable quality. Measures are set forth that can be used to assess modeling efficiency and quality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,3,43,63

The Collaborative Software Engineering Methodology is presented as a framework that contains mechanisms to support three layers of user involvement: selected user representatives, user groups, and the broader user community. Productivity and user participation of traditional group meetings have been limited by chauffeured facilitation and by support of single-user tools designed for analysts rather than users. The paper introduces electronic meeting systems (EMS) modeling tools designed to allow users to work in parallel to contribute directly during meetings. These tools are easy to use while containing support features traditionally associated with CASE tools. The methodology includes a sequence of requirements abstractions that users engage directly including activity models, data models, scenarios, system use eases, and prototypes. This methodology is designed to help organizations respond to today's rapidly changing information processing needs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,3,179,222

Yet developing countries have continued to increase their investment in IT rapidly. Given this apparent disconnect, there is a need for new research to study whether the investment has begun to pay off in greater productivity for developing countries. We analyze new data on IT investment and productivity for 45 countries from 1994 to 2007, and compare the results with earlier research. We find that upper-income developing countries have achieved positive and significant productivity gains from IT investment in the more recent period as they have increased their IT capital stocks and gained experience with the use of IT. We also find that the productivity effects of IT are moderated by country factors, including human resources, openness to foreign investment, and the quality and cost of the telecommunications infrastructure. The academic implication is that the effect of IT on productivity is expanding from the richest countries into a large group of developing countries. The policy implication is that lower-tier developing countries can also expect productivity gains from IT investments, particularly through policies that support IT use, such as greater openness to foreign investment, increased investment in tertiary education, and reduced telecommunications costs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,97,122

Will a manufacturer use more or fewer suppliers due to the increasing use of IT? Based on data from a sample of 150 U.S. manufacturers, we find no direct relationship between e-procurement and number of suppliers at the aggregate level. However, when we distinguish the type of goods purchased, we find that the use of electronic procurement is associated with buying from more suppliers for custom goods but from fewer suppliers for standard (or commodity) goods. It is possible that for commodity goods, an efficiently functioning transparent market ensures that a few suppliers are sufficient, whereas for custom goods the need for protection from opportunistic vendor holdup leads to the use of more suppliers. Further, the positive relationship between number of suppliers and electronic procurement for custom goods is negatively moderated by deeper buyer--supplier system integration. This implies that such integration can help buyers obtain better ""fit"" for their customized requirements, an alternative to increasing fit by employing more suppliers as proposed in the extant literature.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,2,41,72

As projects expand in size and complexity, and competition grows, firms are reengineering their software processes. They are adopting more intensive procedures for requirements management, project planning, defect tracking, configuration management, design and code inspections, and so forth. To assess the effectiveness of these efforts, we conducted a survey of senior practitioners at the 1993 Software Engineering Process Group National Meeting.

Event studies have become an increasingly popular technique for information systems research by giving researchers a tool to measure the notoriously elusive value of information technology. We find evidence that the traditional event study methodology may not provide an accurate measure of abnormal returns during periods of high market volatility, and propose an alternative methodology. The alternative methodology does not use an estimation period, and takes into account extreme or unusual market movements in the period in which the e-commerce announcement was made. Using the alternative methodology, we find evidence of positive abnormal returns for e-commerce announcements made in the fourth quarter of 1998, but no abnormal returns to e-commerce announcements made in the fourth quarter of 2000. We also find significant differences in value depending on the type of e-commerce initiative. In 2000, e-commerce initiatives with a digital product were valued significantly more than e-commerce initiatives with a tangible product, while in 1998 no such difference existed. In 1998, business-to-business e-commerce initiatives, e-commerce initiatives with a tangible product, and e-commerce initiatives by pure-play Internet firms were valued more than similar initiatives in 2000. The study makes a significant contribution for understanding the value of e-commerce initiatives in highly volatile markets and demonstrates how market values of e-commerce changed from 1998 to 2000. Furthermore, this study shows the importance of carefully considering both the time frame examined and the methodology used when assessing the value relevance of e-commerce initiatives as to avoid inflating the magnitude of any observed effects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,55,82

Nevertheless, the extent to which consumers truly prefer to use these new outlets to discuss lesser-known products as opposed to spending most of their energies on discussing widely marketed or already successful products has so far remained an open question. We explore this question by investigating how a population's propensity to contribute postconsumption online reviews for different products of the same category (motion pictures) relates to various indicators of those products' popularity. We discover that, ceteris paribus, consumers prefer to post reviews for products that are less available and less successful in the market. At the same time, however, they are also more likely to contribute reviews for products that many other people have already commented on online. The presence of these two opposite forces leads to a U-shaped relationship between a population's average propensity to review a movie postconsumption and that movie's box office revenues: moviegoers appear to be more likely to contribute reviews for very obscure movies but also for very high-grossing movies. Our findings suggest that online forum designers who wish to increase the contribution of user reviews for lesser-known products should make information about the volume of previously posted reviews a less-prominent feature of their sites.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,127,157

Typically, IT cost for the same performance level declines over time. In a competitive market, a decline in IT cost over time provides a cost advantage to the later entrant, making the early entrant's investment decision problem challenging. In this paper, we study the problem of strategic IT investments in the declining cost scenario using a sequential duopoly model. Our results show that declining IT cost intensifies or relaxes competition between firms depending on whether they are serving quality- or price-sensitive markets. In both cases, the average price per unit quality decreases when the IT cost declines, which benefits consumers. We also show that if the first entrant is uncertain about the extent of its cost disadvantage, the first entrant overinvests (underinvests) in a price-sensitive (quality-sensitive) market as the degree of uncertainty increases.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,321,350

We examine the performance of an SaaS set up under different coordination strategies between these two players. Our analysis indicates that coordination between the monopoly ASP and the AIP can result in an outcome with the same overall surplus as can be achieved by a central planner. Even though the players have an incentive to deviate, it is possible to create the right incentives so that the economically efficient outcome is also the Nash equilibrium. The results of the analysis have significant implications for the coordination strategies for providers in the burgeoning business model of delivering software services over the Internet.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2010,4,119,143

Nine BPR projects were executed and analyzed in detail, leading to the identification of 87 themes regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the project. These themes were organized into 12 categories of lessons learned that provide insight into the ""best practices"" and together informed the evolution of the collaborative business engineering (CBE) approach to BPR.

To do so, users need to overcome many problems associated with their system use in order to integrate the new IS into their work routines. Much remains to be learned about the types of problems that users encounter in using the new system, in particular, the root causes of system use problems and how they relate to and co-evolve with the problems over time. In this study, we seek to develop a comprehensive and dynamic view of system use problems in organizations. Using a combined method of revealed causal mapping and in-depth network analysis, we analyze nine-month archival data on user-reported problems with a new business intelligence application in a large organization. Our data analysis revealed seven emergent constructs of system use problems and causes, including reporting, data, workflow, role authorization, users' lack of knowledge, system error, and user-system interaction. The seven constructs were found to interact differentially across two usage phases (initial versus continued) and between two types of users (regular versus power user). This study contributes to advancing our theoretical understanding of postadoptive IS use by focusing on its problematic aspect. This study also suggests useful methods for organizations to effectively monitor users' system use problems over time and thus guides organizations to effectively target mechanisms to promote the use of new technologies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,291,326

The goal of this research was to develop and evaluate an alternative process to the traditional sequence of interviews or the increasingly common use of JAD (Joint Application Design) meetings run by professional facilitators/modelers. The authors began by selecting one commonly used modeling technique (IDEF0) and adapting its traditional modeling process to use an enabling technology of a group support system (GSS). They developed a special-purpose GSS tool to support the process and tested it through a series of eight field trials over a sixteen-month period. They then compared the new GSS-based technique with the traditional JAD technique in an additional series of eighteen field studies (nine JAD, nine GSS) over a two-year period. The results indicate that the GSS technique reduced the time required to build models by about 75 percent. Models built using GSS and the traditional JAD approach had similar numbers of syntax errors. Project managers perceived the GSS models to be as good as or better than the traditional JAD models in accurately defining the business process.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1999,4,115,142

When there was a distinct majority/minority, groups exchanged more information, made better decisions, and took no more time when they used a GSS than when they did not use a GSS. In this case, the GSS enabled the minority to overcome the group's inertia toward the majority preference. In the uniform treatment where there was no majority preference, groups exchanged more information but made worse decisions and took more time when they used a GSS than when they did not. The primary cause for the poor performance when using the GSS was that group members did not process and use information received during discussion.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,3,61,88

Priming is a well-known phenomenon for individual behavior, but we do not know whether priming can be used to influence group behavior. We developed a Web-based computer game that was designed to improve creativity through priming. Participants were exposed to a priming game and then worked as members of a group using electronic brainstorming (EBS) to generate ideas on a creativity task. Our results show that when users played the game, designed to improve performance, their groups generated significantly more ideas that were more creative than when they were exposed to neutral priming. Our findings extend the literature by providing evidence that individual priming substantially affects group idea generation performance. Avenues for future research include designing EBS software that optimizes group ideation through priming, examining the conditions under which priming has the most substantial impact on ideation performance, and examining whether priming can be used to enhance other group processes (e.g., convergence tasks).",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,195,216

A research model, which suggests that task interdependence, goal conflict, and coordination strategies significantly affect productivity and satisfaction associated with software design and coding activities, is presented. Issues such as contingency/design misfit, conflicting contingencies, and the extent of deviation to theoretically prescribed coordination mechanisms applied to contingencies are used to make predictions on productivity and process satisfaction. A 2x2x2 factorial experiment was utilized. Overall, projects characterized by low task interdependence exhibited greater productivity than projects with high task interdependence. Also, in general, organic coordination was more productive than mechanistic coordination. There was also a significant interaction between task interdependence and coordination strategy. Low goal conflict and organic coordination each lead to greater process satisfaction. Productivity results for the goal conflict manipulation was opposite to the hypothesized direction. Unconflicted contingencies addressed with consistent coordination and partially conflicted contingencies, regardless of the coordination used, exhibited significant gains in productivity. In comparison, unconflicted contingencies with inconsistent coordination and conflicted contingencies, regardless of the coordination applied, resulted in lower productivity. This suggests that there are instances where multiple contingencies, which warrant the use of different coordination strategies, can be adequately addressed with a specific coordination strategy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,41,70

In this paper, we examine the ability of this technology to support the search for competitive advantage. Building on prior research on competitive advantage and group processes, we propose a three-stage process to guide the search for competitive advantage, describe an information system to support this process, and examine the experiences of five groups from three firms that have used this system to support this process.

It is our contention that these differences in findings are not inconsistent, but rather they reflect different situations that researchers have studied. We identify 24 potentially important differences in organizational contexts, group characteristics, tasks, and EMS environments. In planning future research, EMS researchers need to make explicit design decisions for each of these aspects, and to consider how those choices may affect research results. An analysis of these differences suggests several approaches to enhance the design of future laboratory experiments and field studies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,3,107,135

Group support systems (GSS), an information technology designed to improve group work, may therefore have useful application to strategic planning. In this paper, the application of GSS is examined with respect to four dimensions: process support, process structure, task support, and task structure. A GSS may assist the communication aspects of group meetings by providing process support to improve interaction among participants and process structure to direct the pattern or content of the discussion. GSS may also provide task structure, such as structured analysis and modeling techniques, and task support, such as access to important task information. This paper reports on the use of a GSS in the strategic planning processes of thirty organizations. The ability of the GSS to provide process support was found to be the most important contributor to strategic planning success, with task structure and process structure secondary. Task support contributed little.

Results show that process satisfaction is higher for idea-generation tasks than for decision-making tasks. The GSS tool (that is, the use of level 1 or level 2 GSS) influences decision quality. Level 1 tools support the exchange of information, whereas, level 2 tools are designed to aid in decision-making. Decision quality is higher when using level 2 tools, however, there is no difference in the number of ideas generated when using level 1 or level 2 tools. Decision quality is lower for virtual teams, but there is no difference in the number of ideas generated between virtual teams and face-to-face teams using GSS. Group size is an important moderator when measuring decision time and satisfaction with process. The former is shorter for larger groups, and the latter is higher for larger groups. Process facilitation leads to higher decision quality and higher satisfaction with the process. These results illustrate the importance of examining the moderators of GSS use and the viability of conducting a meta-analysis to investigate a large body of research with seemingly conflicting or equivocal results.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,235,257

Decentralization may bring flexibility and fast response to changing business needs, as well as other benefits, but decentralization also makes systems integration difficult, presents a barrier to standardization, and acts as a disincentive toward achieving economies of scale. As a result, there is a need to balance the decentralization of IT management to business units with some centralized planning for technology, data, and human resources. Here we explore three major mechanisms for facilitating interunit coordination of IT management: structural design approaches, functional coordination modes, and computer-based communication systems. We define these various mechanisms and their interrelationships, and we discuss the relative costs and benefits associated with alternative coordination approaches. To illustrate the cost-benefit tradeoffs of coordination approaches, we present a case study in which computer-based communication systems were used to support team-based coordination of IT management across dispersed business units. Our analysis reveals possibilities for future approaches to IT coordination in large, dispersed organizations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1994,4,85,110

Advanced manufacturing technologies have also improved sellers' manufacturing flexibility. These changes allow an online seller to offer custom products at discriminatory prices. We show that these technologies offer significant advantages to an early adopter who gains market share and profits at the expense of the conventional seller. Not only does the customizing seller charge more for customized products, it also provides standard products but charges more for them than in a conventional market. The benefits of customization disappear when both the competing sellers adopt customization. They now compete not just on prices but also on degree of customization. Consequently, we see that the sellers ""over-customize,"" to the detriment of their profits. Both the sellers know this when choosing their customization strategies and yet they both end up choosing to customize. A seller that does not customize sees a sharp decrease in profits if its competitor customizes. This is an instance of the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" type of situation in technology adoption. This confirms some key findings in IT productivity and strategic IT investments literature.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,2,9,28

These add-ins enhance the functionality of the base product. Unless protected by patents, these add-ins can potentially be bundled into the base software. The impact of this bundling on the profits of the base software producer and the consumer depends on the proportion of consumers that value the add-in and the penalty that some consumers incur from finding only a bundled product available when they do not desire the add-in. Using a model of the market, we show that the price of the bundle will be less than the sum of the prices of the base and add-in software when they are sold separately. We also show that the total consumer surplus and the social welfare increase if the base software producer's profit increases with bundling.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,2,99,111

Angst;  Sarv Devaraj;  John D'Arcy,Dual Role of IT-Assisted Communication in Patient Care: A Validated Structure-Process-Outcome Framework, business value of information technology;  health information technology;  operational IT;  strategic IT;  structure-process-outcome,"Despite the fact that about 90 percent of information transactions in hospitals are communications between patients, doctors, nurses, and other staff, little research has addressed the role that information technology (IT) plays in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of these communications-based transactions. Addressing this research gap is important considering that a substantial number of adverse hospital events stem from communication failures. Furthermore, effective communication is a major driver of patient satisfaction in hospitals. Using a structure-process-outcome (SPO) framework and guided by the strategic role of IT literature, we develop a model that includes ""structure,"" operationalized as organizational characteristics and two different categories of IT; ""process,"" two different communication-based processes; and ""outcomes,"" quantified as case-mix adjusted mortality, patient loyalty, and patient ratings. Specifically, we hypothesize that a subset of clinical IT (cardiology IT) will affect technical protocols of patient care, which in turn affects mortality, while administrative IT will affect interpersonal patient care, which relates to patient loyalty and ratings. Thus, IT can serve as a double-edged sword affecting both technical and interpersonal processes of care, but possibly independently and differentially. We test our hypotheses on 2,179 hospitals using data collected and matched from three different sources. Our findings suggest that different types of IT differentially affect hospital processes and these same processes influence performance metrics such as mortality and patient satisfaction. For example, cardiology IT has a greater effect on objective patient health status through improvements in the technical protocols of care. Surprisingly, administrative IT was shown to adversely affect interpersonal care processes. It could be true that the IT is intrusive and interferes in the doctor-patient relationship; however, a post hoc analysis suggests the possibility of curvilinear impacts. Thus, managers should recognize that over- and underinvestment in IT can potentially have negative effects on performance and these results vary by IT type. Both technical and interpersonal processes yielded significant relationships to their respective outcomes and some cross-outcome effects were found, further suggesting that the mediating role of processes is an important link between IT and value.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,2,257,292

Content is costly but attracts viewers, whereas advertisement generates revenues but repels viewers. The period-by-period balancing decision is further complicated by the growth and diffusion nature of Web site viewership. This decision problem is modeled as a control problem that captures the essence of the business model of such Web sites. Using this model we show that it may be optimal for the Web site to initially have negative cash flows from having fewer advertisements and more content. This is more than compensated for by future profits from the Web site. We use the solution to the control problem to also develop a forward-looking measure of Web traffic called the 'discounted total traffic.' We empirically examine this new measure and find that it better predicts market capitalization than backward-looking measures like page views.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,87,98

The portals attract a disproportionate amount of the Internet advertising dollars and have the ability to influence the success of new electronic commerce ventures. Using monthly audience data, we examine relative market shares of Web sites in search engines, travel, financial, news, and other categories. We find clear evidence of increasing disparity in page views, with the top Web sites getting an increasing share of the market. Using economic modeling, we show that this disparity is a result of a development externality that exists in this industry: the sites that have more viewers get more revenues; this in turn allows them to develop more content and attract an even greater number of viewers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,2,181,199

In this paper, we examine the effect of such proactive use of information in the setting of e-commerce retailing where duopoly retailers set their prices of a commodity that is in short supply. We show that when customer reservation value is relatively high and retailers are differentiated in fill rate, both retailers choose the dynamic pricing strategy in equilibrium. By investing in Web scraping technology, retailers automatically monitor each other's stock status and dynamically adjust prices contingent on rival's stock availability.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,2,167,194

We examine the problem of designing free software trials under a general learning function. Our analyses lead to several new findings. We find that a time-locked trial is optimal only when the rate of learning is sufficiently large. It is not optimal in other situations, even when it has an overall positive effect on consumers' valuations. We also find that positive network effects have a minimal impact on this optimality. Interestingly, we find that neither the optimal trial period nor the optimal price is monotonically increasing in the rate of learning. At moderate rates, the software manufacturer pursues a dual strategy of offering a longer trial as well as a lower price. At higher rates of learning, the manufacturer does the opposite. Our results are robust, and incorporating possibilities such as a trial providing a signal of quality or learning being correlated with prior valuation has little impact on their applicability.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,2,239,268

Yet the market coverage is relatively low. Prior research has not attempted to explain what makes this market so different. In this paper, we develop an economic model to find possible answers to this question. Our model uses existing classification of different types of attacks and models their resulting network effects. We find that the negative network effect from indirect attacks, which is further enhanced by value-based targeted attacks, provides a possible explanation for the unique structure of this market. Overall, our results highlight the unique nature of the security software market, furnish rigorous arguments for several counterintuitive observations in the real world, and provide managerial insights for vendors on market competition.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,2,77,108

Despite the fact that almost all such systems are in their experimental stages, designers are optimistic about their eventual success. In the last few years, there have been many references to the possibility of expert systems in the management literature. However, what is lacking is a clear theoretical perspective on how various management problems differ in nature from problems in other domains and the implications of these differences for knowledge-based decision support systems for management. In this paper, I examine some of these differences, what they suggest in terms of the functionality that a computer-based system must have in order to support organizational decision making, and the scope of such a system as a decision aid. The discussion is grounded in the context of a computer-based system called PLANET that exhibits some of the desired functionality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,4,1987,1,25,41

Three configurations were identified: Defined Community, Open Community, and Authoritarian Community. Notably, Defined Community governance had the strongest coordination and project climate and had the most extensive use of outcome, behavior, and clan control mechanisms (controller driven). The controls in the Defined Community governance configuration appear to effectively enable open, coordinated contribution and participation from a wide variety of talented developers (one of the virtues of open source development) while managing the development process and outcomes. The results add to our theoretical understanding of control in different types of information systems projects, as the combination of control modes found in OSS projects is different from those found in previous research for internal or outsourced information systems development projects. This could be due to unique features of OSS projects, such as volunteer participation and the controller being part of the development team. The results provide guidance for practitioners about how to combine 19 identified governance mechanisms into effective project governance that stimulates productive participation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,3,49,80

Saharia;  David Chao,Maintaining Remote Decision Support Databases, decision support systems;  distributed databases;  database snapshots;  consistency in distributed databases,"This research describes and analyzes schemes for managing decision support databases that are extracted from a central database and ""downloaded"" to personal workstations. Unlike a (true) distributed database system, where updates are propagated to maintain consistency, these remote ""snapshots"" are updated only periodically (""refreshed"") upon command of the remote workstation user. This approach to data management has many of the same advantages of a distributed database over a centralized database (e.g., reduced communication costs, improved response time for retrievals, and reduction in contention), but it avoids the high overhead for concurrency control associated with updating in a distributed database. The added cost is in reduced data consistency. The schemes analyzed include full regeneration, the scheme used by System R*, and two new schemes. One new scheme--called modified regeneration--is a variation on simple full regeneration of the snapshot, but transmits only relevant changes to the snapshot. The other new scheme uses a difference table of relevant updates. Algorithm descriptions, models of processing and communication costs, analytical and numerical comparison of performance, and qualitative evaluation are included. Our conclusions are that the difference-table approach is the most robust scheme; the System R* scheme has lowest cost for only rather limited environments; and the modified-regeneration scheme is attractive due to its simplicity and flexibility. The results and models presented here could be used by a DBMS ""refresh optimizer"" to determine the best scheme to employ as a function of refresh frequency, update rate, and various processing and communication cost parameters.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,2,111,138

To be most useful in decision-making, instruments like end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS), which are designed to evaluate system success, should be robust. That is, they should enable comparisons by providing equivalent measurement across diverse samples that represent the variety of conditions or population subgroups present in organizations. Using a sample of 1,166 responses, the EUCS instrument is tested for measurement invariance across four dimensions--respondent positions, types of application, hardware platforms, and modes of development. While the results suggest that the meaning of user satisfaction is context sensitive and differs across population subgroups, the 12 measurement items are invariant across all four dimensions. The 12-item summed scale enables researchers or practitioners to compare EUCS scores across the instrument's originally intended universe of applicability.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,227,262

These services are often delivered by employees who work at widely dispersed locations and interact with each other to constitute knowledge-intensive service delivery networks (KISDNs). This paper contributes to the effective design and management of KISDNs by presenting a mixed-integer programming model that integrates disparate streams of research. This model facilitates analysis and managerial benchmarking of KISDN performance. It captures how the performance of such networks depends on the interaction between workflow decisions, structure of information flow networks (IFNs), and knowledge management decisions. We propose that knowledge about IFNs and worker competence can be effectively used to make workflow decisions. Our results, based on the study of different IFN archetypes, illustrate practices for effective management of KISDNs. Managers can enhance business value by recognizing existing IFNs, increasing randomness in IFNs, nurturing weak or performative ties depending on the archetype, assigning tasks based on effective worker competence, and selectively delaying assignment of tasks to workers. In addition, our results illustrate the impact of training and network density on KISDN performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,3,127,160

The focus of most studies to date has been on the use of aggregated statistical data to answer macro questions regarding aggregates of organizations. On the other hand, there is a serious lack of micro-empirical analysis of turnover/succession and its impacts on managerial performance. This paper reports the results of a simulation-based laboratory study to investigate the impacts of managerial turnover/succession on software project performance. Specifically, the study examines the staffing and cost/schedule trade-off choices of successor project managers, and compares them with the choices made by managers who run their projects from start to finish without interruption. The results indicate that managerial turnover/succession can lead to a discernible (albeit unintended) shift in cost/schedule trade-off choices, affecting staff allocations and ultimately project performance in terms of both cost and duration.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,2,127,144

Among the many problems that new technologies present, one of the first and an extremely important problem that an IS manager must deal with is an economic one: should the firm invest in a project involving the new technology? Traditional capital budgeting approaches do not adequately answer this question. Consequently, they are seldom used. Instead, investments in new IT projects are based upon ""gut feel"" or ""intuition,"" rather than hard evidence. A major portion of the value of new IT projects accrues from future projects that use the technology. Few benefits are obtained from the initial project. Problems in trying to capture these benefits using traditional capital budgeting approaches are discussed here and an alternative approach to valuing new IT investments is present. This approach is based upon the assertion that future investment in projects that use the new IT are optional. Treating future investments as optional can greatly increase the pre-investment estimated value of a new IT project. In addition, the effects of technological characteristics and business and environmental conditions on the value of new IT investments are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1991,4,71,89

However, as documented in prior studies, they often underestimate the challenges about social interactions and users' perceptions in response to new information systems. Based on an interpretive case study, this paper examines the implementation of a KMS to show how social representations of four groups of users resulted in the misalignment of the KMS with the organizational strategy. The social representation lens allows us to interpret strategic alignment in terms of dynamic processes of anchoring and objectification that aid individuals and groups to make sense of KMS initiatives. The groups studied developed different cognitive views of the KMS that ultimately led to a strategic misalignment. The key implication is that social interactions within and among groups shape KMS alignment with organizational strategy, thus elucidating the nature of system use.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,103,126

Although a flexible infrastructure is considered highly valuable under certain circumstances, it is difficult to plan and to measure because there is no common, operational definition. This paper addresses the problem at two levels. First, it presents and explores various efforts to define or describe infrastructure flexibility in the literature. It identifies basic components of IT infrastructure and previously proposed characteristics of flexibility. The discussion considers concepts of IT resource management, including technological architecture, alignment of planning, and human resource skills, all of which have also been linked to definitions of infrastructure flexibility. Second, the paper explores how the concept of infrastructure flexibility is viewed among IT executives. The characteristics of infrastructure may vary with firm resources and industry characteristics such as information intensity; consequently, we may expect flexibility to be either developed or thwarted in a great number of ways. An informal study of IT executives' experience with and opinions of infrastructure flexibility results in a view of the practical issues of infrastructure flexibility. Based on the outcome of this study, a framework is presented for developing tools for future efforts to evaluate infrastructure flexibility. Methods by which the framework may be used to develop individualized infrastructure benchmarking tools are proposed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,2,37,57

Across the world, countries are seeking to improve telecommunications infrastructure and benefit from anticipated increases in economic activity, and a causal relation between the two is often tacitly assumed. This paper analyzes aggregate data at the national level to see if there is any empirical evidence that supports this assumption. We apply the well established Granger test for causality using time series data for levels of telecommunications infrastructure and economic activity from thirty countries. We find that the evidence for causality from levels of telecommunications infrastructure to economic activity is stronger than that for causality in the opposite direction. Moreover, this pattern appears to hold for both industrialized and developing economies, even though the former has strong service sectors that are heavily dependent on telecommunications. These findings provide additional insights into the complex relationship between telecommunications and economic activity. Some potential policy implications are also discussed. Granger causality tests have not seen much application in the IS Literature, and we mention some IS research issues that may benefit from such analysis.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2001,4,71,95

According to this view, most IT work would be drained from the United States to overseas locations. However, the loss of jobs to offshoring has increased pressure to impose restrictions. On the supply side, as IT salaries in outsourcing vendor nations increase, they become less attractive for offshoring. The literature identifies multiple factors--some enhancing, others inhibiting--that affect the growth of offshoring. In this paper, we attempt to add to that knowledge by asking, ""What are the mechanics by which these factors interact to produce the observed growth in IT offshoring?"" We use the system dynamics methodology to build a two-country simulation model of offshoring growth that captures individual cause-effect relationships generated by its supply and demand drivers. Examined as a whole, these individual relationships reveal larger feedback loops that constitute the mechanism underlying offshoring growth between the two countries. Simulation experiments show how the dynamic behavior of offshoring is likely to evolve beyond the current high-growth period. The model contributes to our understanding of offshoring by offering a causal foundation for its growth pattern. It can also be used to computationally study different scenarios of offshoring growth.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,15,35

By reappropriating these derivatives, video game firms are successfully outsourcing parts of their game design and development process to digital consumer networks. Applying economic analysis, we explore the potential benefits and risks associated with outsourcing to networks of consumers. We also derive the optimal combination of copyright enforcement and consumer compensation. Our results suggest that profit-maximizing producers of video games have incentive to partially open game content to their users and to remunerate the most innovative ones, under the condition that the derivatives constitute complements to, and not substitutes for, the original product.

We make use of a theoretically grounded, well-understood, and empirically observable bidder behavior-the winner's curse adjustment for the expected number of bidders in an auction-to examine the relationships between bidder experience, bidding patterns, and the winner's curse adjustment in rare coin online auctions. We also examine the impact of uncertainty on the winner's curse adjustment, both by using precise measures of uncertainty and by considering seller and bidder strategies for reducing that uncertainty. We analyze a complete record of all auctions in a three-month period for rare U. S. coins, examining 284,681 bids from 62,625 auctions hosted by eBay, the market leader in online auctions. One of the main contributions of this paper is to demonstrate that the bidding patterns associated with different bidders are strongly related to whether they calculate their bids to take into account the number of competing bidders, as predicted for common-value auctions. This is a substantial extension and empirical confirmation of prior work that has explored the implications of different observed patterns of bidding. We also explore new territory by examining the relationships between bidder experience, bidding patterns observed, and the economic outcomes for bidders. We are able to show that bidders with more domain-specific experience (rather than general auction experience) make better adjustments for the winner's curse, that experience has an effect on the type of bidding strategy, and that the type of bidding strategy has a significant effect on the economic outcomes for the bidders.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,241,268

The current study compares two different EMS software tools in a controlled experiment. Dependent variables are decision quality, number of unique alternatives generated, satisfaction, and consensus. The study found that one software tool produced better quality solutions to a combination creativity and intellective task, but the other helped generate more unique alternatives. Each tool worked best on the task for which it was designed. The findings support the authors' premise that there should be a match between the EMS software tool and the task to be performed. The findings have several implications for the design of EMS software.",Journal of Management Information Systems,7,1990,1,85,100

Software maintenance projects differ significantly from original development projects, indicating a need for more research specifically concerning maintenance processes. This study uses a grounded theory research method to explore how information technology professionals define and select a methodology to maintain existing software. We found that in-use maintenance methodologies are composed of components from multiple formal methodologies. We developed a factor model describing how these components are chosen. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how standard methodologies are applied in software practice and the critical factors used by professionals when choosing an appropriate methodology for software maintenance activities.

The end-user computing (EUC) literature contains many prescriptions for managing this activity, but there has been little direct empirical examination of the effectiveness of end users as application developers. This paper describes a study in which five different applications were developed independently by paired teams of end users and IS students acting as surrogate IS professionals. This permitted comparison of end users and surrogate IS professionals on the quality of the finished applications and on productivity. The quality analysis focused on technical design and implementation factors as measured by defect counting and a subjective quality attribute rating. Productivity was measured by function point analysis and lines-of-code metrics. The results of the study indicate that the surrogate IS professionals were much more productive and produced higher-quality applications than did the end users. The fact that student surrogates significantly outperformed the end users is particularly interesting since experienced IS professionals might be expected to show even greater differences in productivity and quality. The study should be replicated using IS professionals to confirm the preliminary findings. The results suggest that additional research on the efficacy of end users as application developers is needed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,1,167,185

We share the perception that not only are small countries not at a disadvantage, but they may actually have an advantage over larger competitors with regard to information technology industries. Indeed, small developed countries are achieving considerable success in the development of their information technology industries. The three countries studied here--Israel, New Zealand, and Singapore--are among those that have seen the rapid development of their IT industries in recent years, despite the fact that they are among the world's smaller countries, are considerably different in many geographic, cultural, and political respects, and are geographically dispersed around the globe. The objective of this study is to describe and compare the information technology industries of these three small developed countries. All three countries, with no inherent advantages in raw materials and only small domestic markets, have the IT infrastructure and the human skills needed. They are nimble and flexible and can find niche markets in which to specialize. Not all three, however, have developed IT industries to the same degree. There could be factors specific to small developed countries that facilitate the development of indigenous IT production. The dominant factor that seems to provide some explanation for different levels and directions of development of IT production is government policy in promoting IT production directly, in supporting IT industry R&D;, and in education policies designed to provide appropriately trained labor pools.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1997,4,61,89

The approach developed in this study relaxes the assumption usually made for natural language query systems that the context, in the form of a specific database, is given. The formal model defines a universe of discourse consisting of multiple contexts, each of which is represented by a database, which consists of a dictionary, a thesaurus, relations, columns, and values. A mechanism for identifying and selecting the appropriate context for a query and its implementation as a prototype are described. The integration of this mechanism into the general model of natural language query processing is indicated and implementational issues are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,1,171,197

However, we know little about the antecedents of the end user's perceived behavioral control (PBC) with respect to IT. Drawing on Kurt Lewin's field theory, the present study responds to this concern by formulating and testing a model whereby individual, contextual, and social forces influence PBC directly and indirectly via computer anxiety. In order to test the model, a survey was conducted in France with IT end users enrolled in professional training programs. The results show that increasing autonomy, offering appropriate managerial support, reducing work overload, and perceived innovativeness with IT can together reduce computer anxiety and increase PBC. These findings emphasize the forces that managers can manipulate in order to foster users' feelings of control with respect to IT in the workplace. Following this, the paper makes three main contributions to research. First, it increases our knowledge of the nomological net surrounding PBC by shedding light on the joint influences of internal, external, and social forces on this variable. Second, it reveals the role of computer anxiety, emphasizing that it is an important conduit through which these forces influence workers' PBC. Third, the paper shows how Lewin's field theory can help to create richer and less fragmented models in order to capture more fully the determinants of IT adoption and adaptation. The practical implications regarding the actions that managers can take in order to increase workers' PBC are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,3,201,234

Self-affirmation theory suggests that human expert users could be experiencing threat, causing them to act defensively and ignore the system's conflicting recommendations. Previous research has demonstrated that affirming an individual in an unrelated area reduces defensiveness and increases objectivity to conflicting information. Using an affirmation manipulation prior to a credibility assessment task, this study investigated if experts are threatened by counterattitudinal expert system recommendations. For our study, 178 credibility assessment experts from the American Polygraph Association (n = 134) and the European Union's border security agency Frontex (n = 44) interacted with a deception detection expert system to make a deception judgment that was immediately contradicted. Reducing the threat prior to making their judgments did not improve accuracy, but did improve objectivity toward the system. This study demonstrates that human experts are threatened by advanced expert systems that contradict their expertise. As more and more systems increase integration of artificial intelligence and inadvertently assail the expertise and abilities of users, threat and self-evaluative concerns will become an impediment to technology acceptance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,249,262

Drawing on regulatory focus theory and social cognitive theory, we developed and tested a model of the motivational dynamics underlying corporate wikis. We examined leaders (owners) and users of 187 wiki-based projects within a large multinational firm. Our findings revealed two countervailing motivational forces, one oriented toward accomplishment and achievement (promotion focus) and one oriented toward safety and security (prevention focus), that not only predicted owners' participation but also the overall level of engagement within the wiki groups. Our primary contribution is in showing that, notwithstanding the potential benefits to users, wikis can trigger risk-avoidance motives that potentially impede engagement. Practically, our findings call for an alignment between organizational procedures surrounding wiki deployment and the technology's affordances.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,87,116

The Nick support technologies explicitly aided the affective social meeting structures, as well as the rational task-oriented processes. Analysis of the experimental data revealed some gains in meeting effectiveness and quality from use of the Nick meeting support technologies.

Not surprisingly, the ""experts"" that perform this evaluation are seldom skilled in all the disciplines necessary to accomplish a thorough evaluation of the environmental indicators. While one expert may be skilled at recognizing the potential for political turmoil in a foreign nation, another at Motorola is skilled at recognizing how Japanese government deregulation is meant to complement the development of new products. Moreover, these experts often benefit from each other's skills and knowledge in assessing activity in the organization's environment. Often the interchange among variously skilled analysts becomes a distributed problem-solving activity that creates the high-quality, interdisciplinary analysis essential for an effective environmental monitoring activity. Problems in the environmental monitoring process often occur when a particular expertise, an agent in the problem-solving network, is unavailable, and knowledge from that domain does not play a role in the analysis. The focus of this paper is on the distribution of expertise and the sharing of knowledge in the critical process of environmental monitoring. A technical approach is adapted in this effortâ€”an architecture and a prototype of ""delegation technologies"" are described that provide the capability of capturing, organizing, and distributing knowledge that may be used by experts in classifying patterns of qualitative indicators in the business environment. The redistribution of responsibilities through the delegation to, and coordination of, intelligent agents is examined.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,1,37,62

Based on field research across multiple firms (software development, product development, financial services, and high technology), we outline five types of boundaries that we encountered in our field research (geographical, functional, temporal, identity, and organizational) and discuss methodological issues in distinguishing the effects of one boundary where multiple boundaries exist. We suggest that it is important to: (1) appropriately measure the boundary of interest to the study, (2) assess and control for other influential boundaries within and across teams, and (3) distinguish the effects of each boundary on each team outcome of interest. Only through careful attention to methodology can we properly assess the effects of team boundaries and appreciate their research and practical implications for designing and using information systems to support collaborative work.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2003,4,157,190

In this field study, we investigate the coordination needs of software teams, how team knowledge affects coordination, and how this effect is influenced by geographic dispersion. Our findings show that software teams have three distinct types of coordination needs--technical, temporal, and process--and that these needs vary with the members' role; geographic distance has a negative effect on coordination, but is mitigated by shared knowledge of the team and presence awareness; and shared task knowledge is more important for coordination among collocated members.

The determinants are tested for their relationships to IC success and one another in order to evaluate which have a direct impact on success and which operate indirectly. Prior studies have not looked for relationships among factors, omitting potentially helpful information. Data were gathered from 151 users representing three organizations and were used to develop a model of IC success. The model is consistent with Anthony's levels of management activity in that the determinants correspond to specific levels of planning and control. The determinants and their corresponding management activity levels are as follows: IC role definition is associated with strategic planning, while management control encompasses a variety of services, staff infrastructure, and organizational commitment. Operational control, in the IC environment, is concerned with quality of user-developed applications, quality of individual staff, quality of services, facilitation of end-user computing, and user self-sufficiency. This model of IC success can guide researchers studying information centers and, especially, managers charged with establishing and operating information centers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,2,95,117

An experimental study with 272 undergraduate and graduate student volunteers supported all the hypotheses. In addition, it was found that the relationship between the factors and perceived quality was mediated by the perception of the flaws.

Our results suggest that while some information processing design choices are generally related to organizational performance, others should be matched to a specific strategic posture. For example, we found that all organizations benefit from using IT to increase cost-effectiveness. However, other uses of IT should be more closely aligned with an organization's strategy. In particular, domain offensive organizations should align their IT systems to focus on the front end of their operations and understanding customer needs, which will spur further innovation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,1,293,319

In this study, we take a data-driven approach to measure Web site navigability using Web data readily available in organizations. Guided by information foraging and information-processing theories, we identify fundamental navigability dimensions that should be emphasized in metric development. Accordingly, we propose three data-driven metrics-namely, power, efficiency, and directness-that consider Web structure, usage, and content data to measure a Web site's navigability. We also develop a Web mining-based method that processes Web data to enable the calculation of the proposed metrics. We further implement a prototype system based on the Web mining-based method and use it to assess the navigability of two sizable, real-world Web sites with the metrics. To examine the analysis results by the metrics, we perform an evaluation study that involves these two sites and 248 voluntary participants. The evaluation results show that user performance and assessments are consistent with the analysis results revealed by our metrics.

Building upon Lave and Wenger's theory of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP), this paper offers a longitudinal investigation of one OSS community in which sustained participation is hypothesized to be associated with the coevolution of two major elements of LPP theory: ""situated learning"" (the process of acting knowledgeably and purposefully in the world) and ""identity construction"" (the process of being identified within the community). To test this hypothesis, data were collected from multiple sources, including online public project documents, electronic mail messages, tracker messages, and log files. Results from qualitative analyses revealed that initial conditions to participate did not effectively predict long-term participation, but that situated learning and identity construction behaviors were positively linked to sustained participation. Furthermore, this study reveals that sustained participants distinguished themselves by consistently engaging in situated learning that both made conceptual (advising others) and practical contributions (improving the code).

We develop a theoretical model that explains how these three factors interact to determine the quality of Wikipedia articles. The results from the empirical study of 96 Wikipedia articles suggest that (1) diversity should be encouraged, as the creative abrasion that is generated when cognitively diverse members engage in task-related conflict leads to higher-quality articles, (2) task conflict should be managed, as conflict â€”notwithstanding its contribution to creative abrasionâ€”can negatively affect group output, and (3) groups should maintain a balance of both administrative- and content-oriented members, as both contribute to the collaborative process.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,71,98

One possibility for providing active high cognitive level decision support is through facilitating alternative generation in DSS.

The method relies on the principles of effective problem-solving/decision-making and facilitates divergent processes, the separation of alternative generation from evaluation, as well as the diminishing of human cognitive biases. A hybrid DSS based on genetic algorithms (GA) and fuzzy sets is used to operationalize the approach. The paper outlines the design requirements for alternative generation in DSS and discusses the inadequacies of the ""what-if"" simulation and traditional optimization methods in light of these requirements. The paper further elaborates on the appropriateness of GA as a tool for alternative generation in DSS for solving complex ill-structured problems. The method is illustrated using marketing mix problem in a simulated business environment. The results suggest that the GA-based alternative generation leads to promising diverse alternatives.

This paper investigates the optimal channel structure and the corresponding pricing and service strategies for digital content distribution in order to understand the business value of introducing the C2C channel alongside the prevailing B2C channel. We identify conditions under which it is more profitable to use both B2C and C2C channels simultaneously (i.e., the dual-channel distribution). In such cases, the seller performs price discrimination among consumers but provides them with a higher level of service. Our analysis further characterizes the benefits of service provision. We show that service provision can increase the dual-channel pricing flexibility, reduce the seller's B2C channel dependence, and allow the seller to tolerate higher C2C channel redistribution costs. Finally, in examining the effect of a competitively determined B2C channel price on optimal channel strategy, we find that the seller prefers a dual-channel distribution under higher B2C channel prices.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2009,4,241,270

Although technological developments affecting the productivity of systems professionals are relatively easy to isolate, the effects of differences in management are harder to assess. This paper reports the results of a two-stage effort to develop, validate, and score an instrument for measuring differences in management. In the first stage an instrument and scoring procedures for measuring the work-unit environment were developed and shown to have acceptable reliability and validity. In the second stage the work-unit environment instrument and scoring procedures were adapted to yield a shorter instrument for measuring differences in demonstrated skill at supervising. Based on different assumptions about the desirability of mid-range work-unit environments, alternative scoring algorithms are used with responses to the ten-item survey to yield alternate indices of demonstrated skill at supervising. Although factor and reliability analyses support the reliability and validity of the instrument, the scoring algorithms require further research.

The taxonomy of IT structure is based on the degree of centralization of computer processing, capability to support communications, and the ability to share resources. By using a multistep cluster analysis, both the membership and number of groups are derived from the responses of 313 firms. Four IT structures are identified: centralized (centralized processing, low communication, low sharing), decentralized (decentralized processing, low communication, low sharing), centralized cooperative (centralized processing, high communication, high sharing), and distributed cooperative computing (decentralized processing, high communication, high sharing). Centralized computing is related to functional organizational forms with low integration and centralized decision making.

This paper is a concise overview of what has been studied and how: the systems, independent, intervening, adaptation, and dependent variables, manipulated or measured, and experimental procedures employed. Part I categorizes the contextual and intervening factors. Part II analyzes 1,582 hypotheses resulting from pairings of independent and dependent variables. The results show that the modal outcome for group support systems (GSS) compared with face-to-face (FtF) methods is ""no difference,"" while the overall percentage of positive effects for hypotheses that compare GSS with FtF is a disappointing 16.6 percent. Experiments with seven to ten groups per treatment condition working on idea-generation tasks and using GSS technology show an improvement up to 29.0 percent. These results are moderated by technology, process structure, communication mode, group factors, task type, the number of experimental groups per treatment condition, and the type of dependent variable measured. The purpose of this paper is to aid the GSS researcher by presenting detailed results of what has been studied and found in previous experiments, along with a discussion of what needs to be studied.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,3,7,149

As such, they are a major application domain for temporally oriented information systems (TOIS), which are distinguished by their explicit handling of time and memory. Although TOIS have been studied vigorously in recent years, there has been no attempt to relate them to the temporal concerns pertinent to these managerial processes. This paper systematically examines the structure of, and access to memory in planning and control activities, in an attempt to identify major related design requirements. The examination proceeds as follows: First, a conceptual framework of planning and control is developed. This framework facilitates the examination of memory aspects of these processes, specifically the extent and nature of memory implied by the underlying models and the actual control schemes. The three themes that emerge from this examination are: (1) the fundamental necessity of temporally independent access to data in planning and control applications; (2) the inherent multiplicity of time perspectives upon which the notions of planning and control rest; and (3) the need to develop temporally oriented model management. These themes identify basic temporal functionalities that TOIS need to address. Current research on temporally oriented information systems, as assessed against these criteria, has not come up yet with adequate answers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,2,77,98

This paper examines the conditions under which information systems (IS) specialists and users should assume responsibility and decision-making authority during the SDLC. A contingency model is presented that recommends the type of responsibility and authority roles that users should assume during the SDLC to minimize the risk and uncertainty inherent in developing computer-based systems. The contingency model developed in this paper builds upon the situational characteristics of information system complexity, is department experience, and user past experience in system development. According to the model, certain system factors and systems development experiences require that the user become involved by exercising heavy responsibility and authority roles, while other situational factors suggest light user leadership. The concept of SDLC leadership as responsibility and authority is developed and its meaning for users during each state of the SDLC is discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,2,1985,2,5,25

One hundred turnaround managers rated the importance and availability of seven types of reports (financial, working capital, cost, expense, personnel, asset, and market analyses) at the onset of their engagements. For each type of report, the turnaround managers also specified which levels of reporting, time horizons, reporting intervals, and sources of the information they consider important. Finally, they specified how each type of report is used during financial crises. Results indicate that not all information considered important by turnaround managers in financial crises is available when it is needed. The second major finding was that, for all seven types of analyses, turnaround managers prefer current information that is either by cost/profit centers or detailed, and for all but asset reports, a monthly reporting interval is preferred. Although they consider financial and working capital analyses most important, all seven types of reports are either directly or indirectly used to improve cash flows while a company is in a financial crisis. Because these analyses are not available, it appears that the former CEOs did not use the information that turnaround managers require.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1997,4,167,192

A number of alternatives are emerging where work is performed at remote locations. Existing work practices and managerial strategies are often not appropriate in this environment. In particular, traditional office communication with coworkers and management, which is often dependent on physical proximity, is disrupted. In this study, individual satisfaction with office communication in the telecommuting and conventional work environments is compared through a study of telecommuters and a comparison group of non-telecommuters in nine firms. We investigate the influence of certain organizational factors, such as job characteristics, IT support, and coordination methods, on satisfaction with office communication in the two work environments. We find telecommuters report higher satisfaction with office communication. Our findings indicate that task predictability, IT support, and electronic coordination have similar influences for both groups.

While a number of reports have been published on explaining the XP methodology and the perceived benefits when using XP for system development in recent years, less is known about the actual operationalization of the XP principles. This paper presents an action research study reporting on the experiences of implementing the XP methodology in a development project for a Web-based, distributed information system. The goal of this research was to increase the understanding of how to effectively operationalize XP techniques so that the system being developed catered to today's fast-paced technological environment by allowing the developers to respond quickly to innovative and changing requirements. Overall, the research indicates that most of the XP principles could be effectively implemented; however, three of the principles required modification (i.e., testing, pair programming, customer collocation). Several benefits resulted from the usage of XP. The rapid prototyping enabled information technology developers and users to clarify system requirements, communicate openly, quickly build rapport, and create an interface that was easy to use and learn. Further, the research found that where the technology was new or foreign to the development team and the user, the XP process was flexible enough to support several iterations of technology and produce prototypes in a timely manner. Pair programming appeared to work effectively and offer value; however, it is not always practically feasible.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2006,4,39,68

Information technology enables new forms of producer--consumer collaboration in new product development processes. However, little research exists on consumers' experiences during virtual co-creation tasks. Drawing on the literature on organizational behavior, we introduce the construct of consumer empowerment to describe consumers' perceived influence on product design and decision making. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study investigating how consumers are empowered through Internet-based co-creation activities. To analyze the impact of applied interaction tools, 727 consumers having taken part in virtual co-creation projects were asked about their experienced tool support, their perceived empowerment, how much they enjoyed the task, and their readiness to participate in future co-creation opportunities. The results show that consumers engaging in co-creation feel more or less empowered. The level of experienced empowerment depends on the design of the applied virtual interaction tool, the related enjoyment of the virtual interaction, the participants' task and product involvement, as well as their creativity and lead-user characteristics. The design of the interaction tool determines to what extent consumers with varying capabilities are able to solve the assigned co-creation task. It determines the consumers' perceived empowerment and experienced enjoyment. Both the levels of perceived empowerment and enjoyment have a strong impact on the consumers' willingness to participate in future virtual new product development projects. These findings contribute to a better understanding of antecedents and consequences of successful consumer co-creation. They provide recommendations on how to design a compelling virtual new product co-creation experience.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,71,102

As we hypothesized, group potency and computer collective efficacy act as antecedents to virtual team efficacy, and virtual team efficacy is in turn predictive of perceptual and objective measures of performance. Further, consistent with efficacy theory, we also find that virtual team efficacy acts on performance outcomes through specific mediating processes.

These findings have implications for research beyond the case of information centers. Specifically, they suggest that any implementation research founded on the ""critical success factor"" approach, where managers are asked to judge those factors important to the success of their innovations, will be inadequate unless organizational context is also considered by the researcher in explaining this success.

The DSS development approach differs from traditional systems development not only with regard to its associated paradigms and orientation, but also in the methods of requirements analysis it employs. This paper surveys the major methodologies used for DSS development. It analyzes them by structure, paradigm, and orientation, and discusses their underlying assumptions. A research model is then developed and used to relate the functions of DSS methodology to decision-making environments and the relevant processes within them. Finally, a contingency theory is presented to show how each of the surveyed methodologies reduces the lack of structure in the decision-making environment, and bow this may be used by DSS developers for selecting a DSS methodology. Other components of the research model are discussed, to identify further prerequisites for improved understanding of the DSS role and application.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,1,149,166

Recent literature has examined the value propositions of e-marketplaces and proposed conceptual frameworks for their analysis. In this research, we move beyond conceptual analysis by developing a game-theoretic model of return on-investment (ROI)-driven e-marketplace participation growth. This model provides insights into expected e-marketplace growth and participation, and can be used to determine both the viability and expected long-run size of a given e-marketplace. Our results indicate that the pricing policy of the e-market-place intermediary can affect the rate at which participation grows and, therefore, sentiment about its prospects. We focus on e-marketplaces that add value to buyers and sellers by increasing the efficiency of administrative tasks but also simultaneously add value to buyers and reduce value to sellers by lowering prices for goods purchased. Value to participants in these e-marketplaces is determined by the volume of transactions that can be conducted using the e-marketplace, resulting in a two-sided network effect-buyers reacting to sellers and sellers reacting to buyers. The game-theoretic model identifies an e marketplace equilibrium at which participation growth is predicted to stop.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,1,295,319

Previous studies have shown that few of the errors that might exist in any given spreadsheet are found, even when the reviewer is explicitly looking for errors. It was hypothesized that differences in the spreadsheets' presentation and their formulas could affect the detection rate of these errors. A sample of 113 M.B.A. students volunteered to search for eight errors planted in a one-page spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was presented in five different formats. A 2 x 2 design specified that four groups were given apparently conventional spreadsheets for comparing paper and screen and the presence or absence of formulas. A fifth group received a special printed spreadsheet with formulas visibly integrated into the spreadsheet printed in a small font directly under the resultant values. As in previous studies, only about 50 percent of the errors were found overall. Subjects with printed spreadsheets found more errors than their colleagues with screen-only spreadsheets but they took longer to do so. There was no discernible formula effect; subjects who were able to refer to formulas did not outperform subjects with access to only the final numbers. The special format did not facilitate error finding. Exploratory analysis uncovered some interesting results. The special experimental integrated paper format appeared to diminish the number of correct items falsely identified as errors. There also seemed to be differences in performance that were accounted for by the subjects' self-reported error-finding strategy. Researchers should focus on other factors that might facilitate error finding, and practitioners should be cautious about relying on spreadsheets' accuracy, even those that have been ""audited.""",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,3,45,63

Much of the prior information systems literature has assumed an underlying relationship between ""facilitating conditions"" for information technology (IT) adoption (e.g., user training, technical support, resource availability) and employees' technology use. Although these facilitating conditions are important, they do not provide a complete explanation of employees' IT usage. The reality of working in organizational settings suggests a different model of IT adoption and usage. Drawing from research on social information processing theory, and acknowledging the role of other individuals within the work context that shapes employees' learning, values, and behavior, we propose a framework to explain employees' adoption of IT and their level of usage within organizations, featuring both individual-level factors and factors related to the social information processing influence of co-workers. Our results show that an employee's coworkers exert an important influence on IT usage, whereas individual-level factors exhibit more modest effects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,1,153,192

We introduce and empirically validate the software stack as a structure to measure complementarities. In a sample of mergers and acquisitions, in which either the acquirer or the target is a software firm, we find values of abnormal returns consistent with previous results.

We argue that the two models are distinct (groups do not simultaneously follow both models) and that the key to understanding their use lies in routines. We studied six newly formed groups whose members came from the same organization that worked on similar projects over a seven-week period. Three groups worked nonmediated and three groups used a collaboration technology that was new to them. The three nonmediated groups followed the punctuated equilibrium model and the three collaboration technology groups followed the stage model. We argue that groups that enact the shared routines common in their organizations will experience a different group development path than those groups whose shared routines are disrupted and which must adapt to a new technology. When group members enact shared routines (which they may share due to having a common organizational culture), they can quickly begin work, and group development follows the punctuated equilibrium model. When groups cannot enact shared routines, they must first negotiate how they will work before work can begin, so group development follows the stage model. Thus, the introduction of new collaboration technology (or any new technology or work process) influences how group development occurs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,43,86

The goal of this paper is to develop an empirical approach for measuring information diffusion and discovery in online social networks that have these measurement challenges. We develop such an approach and apply it to data collected from 4,000 users of an online music community. We show that peers on such networks significantly increase music discovery. Moreover, we demonstrate how future research can use this method to measure information discovery and diffusion using data from other online social networks.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,11,38

In many instances, this typifies the relationship between clients and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) customization vendor. This exploratory study examines how trust is built during an ERP implementation, and the relative weight of this trust compared with the perceived qualities of the implemented ERP itself in determining clients' assessment that the business relationship with the vendor is worthwhile. The data, collected from companies that were involved in the process of implementing a new ERP with the on-site assistance of a certain customization vendor, show that all three trust antecedents suggested by Zucker's seminal study of trust--process-based, characteristic-based, and institution-based mechanisms--contribute significantly to client trust. The data also show that client trust in this customization vendor and the perceived usefulness of the ERP both contribute to client assessment that their business relationship with the vendor is worthwhile, showing that both getting the job done and creating a trust-based relationship contribute to this assessment. The implications of the importance of creating trust in ERP implementation and the means of doing how to do so are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,263,288

Previous research examining other Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) modules has shown that user perception of the responsiveness of such teams, as an indicator of a possible social exchange, is significantly associated with an increased favorable assessment of the new system and ultimately its adoption, the reason being that perceived responsiveness creates a constructive social exchange. However, previous research, using survey data alone, did not examine causation. The objective of this study is to examine, using a quasi-experimental design, whether different degrees of actual responsiveness in different sites during CRM implementation result in significant differences in the users' favorable assessment of the correctness and ultimately their approval of a new CRM. The data support these hypotheses, but show that the downstream effects of actual responsiveness are mediated by perceived responsiveness. Implications concerning the social exchange relationship during CRM adoption are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,1,47,69

The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) is introduced as the theoretical base for the hypotheses. The principles of multimedia and coherence from the CTML are used to hypothesize about the effectiveness of graphics embedded in TMC environments. Comprehension and transfer are used as dependent measures. Three TMC interface treatments were considered (no graphic, irrelevant graphic, relevant graphic). Hierarchical analysis of covariance (HANCOVA) comparing TMC treatments indicated no significant differences in comprehension; however, transfer scores for the TMC teams with context-relevant graphics were significantly higher than the other TMC teams. Although adding graphics to the collaborative interface improves the level of understanding developed within a group, the graphics need to be context relevant to be effective. These findings support the coherence and multimedia principles and provide guidance for designers of TMC environments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,97,121

We find that the two important determinants of sellers' advertising strategy are the Repeg Cost Ratio, and the Repeat Sales Coefficient. The interplay of these two factors gives rise to four possible strategic scenarios. In the ambiguous fourth scenario, we show that sellers' strategy for information production goods will differ considerably from information consumption goods based on product complexity and cost of product return (borne by the buyer). Finally, we demonstrate that markets are often characterized by self-reinforcing limits on the extent of opportunistic advertising by sellers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,2,65,88

Improving our understanding of how various factors influence project performance is therefore an important research objective. This study proposes and tests a temporal model of information technology project performance (TMPP). It shows that performance can be better understood by separating risk factors into earlier (a priori) risk factors and later (emergent) risk factors, and modeling the influence of the former on the latter. Project performance, the dependent variable, is measured by considering both process (budget and schedule) and product (outcome) components. The model includes interactions between risk factors, project management practices, and project performance components. The model is tested using partial least squares analysis with data from a survey of 194 project managers. Our results indicate that the TMPP increases explanatory power when compared with models that link risk factors directly to project performance. The results show the importance for active risk management of recognizing, planning for, and managing a priori and emergent risk factors. The finding of a strong relationship between structural risk factors and subsequent volatility shows the need for risk management practice to recognize the interaction of a priori and emergent risk factors. The results confirm the importance of knowledge resources, organizational support, and project management practices, and demonstrate the ways in which they reinforce each other.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,9,44
612, Xianjun Geng;  Young-Jin Lee,Competing with Piracy: A Multichannel Sequential Search Approach, channel competition;  digital good;  digital piracy;  price dispersion;  search cost,"We consider an online market where consumers may obtain digital goods from two mutually exclusive channels: a legitimate channel consisting of many law-abiding retailers and a piracy channel consisting of many piracy services. We analyze consumer choice, retailer strategy, and piracy control using a sequential-search approach where information acquisition is costly for some consumers (nonshoppers), yet costless for others (shoppers). First, we show that a nonshopper's channel choice is determined by a simple comparison of two reservation prices. Second, we analyze how piracy threats affect in-channel pricing among retailers. If the in-channel competition intensity among retailers is high, piracy does not affect retailer pricing. If the intensity is medium, retailers respond to piracy by giving up some shoppers and, surprisingly, raising prices. If the intensity is low, the legitimate channel loses some shoppers as well as some nonshoppers to the piracy channel. Third, we consider several mechanisms for fighting piracy and analyze their effects on firm profit and consumer surplus. Reducing piracy quality and increasing piracy search costs are both effective in controlling piracy, yet they affect consumer surplus differently. Reducing the number of piracy services is less effective in controlling piracy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,2,159,184

Whinston,Effects of Organizational Learning and Knowledge Transfer on Investment Decisions Under Uncertainty, economic analysis;  game theory;  investment under uncertainty;  knowledge transfer;  organizational learning;  signal jamming,"Because uncertainties around innovative technologies resolve over time, investments in such technologies are often made in stages so that organizations can use the knowledge gained from earlier stages to decide the next step. Previous studies usually assume that once some uncertainty is resolved, it becomes common knowledge within the investing organization. We develop a game-theoretical model to study how different parties within an organization gain and transfer knowledge about new technologies while investing in these technologies, and how the learning process may affect the investment decisions. We show that managers with incentives misaligned with the organization may transfer their knowledge untruthfully and distort the learning process of decision makers. Such behavior may lead to inefficient investment decisions. We also study the effect of uncertainty on the misreporting problem and the investment decisions. Mechanisms to mitigate or prevent untruthful knowledge transfer are also proposed. In particular, powerful incentive schemes may alleviate, but not prevent, the misreporting problem; punishing managers who are caught misreporting may deter the misreporting behavior, but in practice such mechanisms are difficult to implement.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,123,145

In secondary markets where suppliers cannot directly utilize used goods for practicing intertemporal price discrimination and where transaction costs of resales are negligible, the threat of cannibalization of new goods by used goods becomes significant. We examine conditions under which it is optimal for suppliers to operate in such markets, explaining why these markets may not always be detrimental for them. Intuitively, secondary markets provide an active outlet for some high-valuation consumers to sell their used goods. The potential for such resales leads to an increase in consumers' valuation for a new good, leading them to buy an additional new good. Given sufficient heterogeneity in consumers' affinity across multiple suppliers"" products, the ""market expansion effect"" accruing from consumers' cross-product purchase affinity can mitigate the losses incurred by suppliers from the direct ""cannibalization effect."" We also highlight the strategic role that the used goods commission set by the retailer plays in determining profits for suppliers. We conclude the paper by empirically testing some implications of our model using a unique data set from the online book industry, which has a flourishing secondary market.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,91,120

This has caused some critics to dismiss IT as a less valuable resource. We argue that, in addition to being able to generate strategic advantage, IT should also be viewed as a strategic necessity that prevents competitive disadvantage in rapidly changing business environments. We test a set of hypotheses on strategic advantage and strategic necessity in the context of Internet banking investments for the population of U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) banks from 2003 to 2005. We seek to understand whether their IT investments were made as a strategic choice or as a result of strategic necessity. Our econometric analysis suggests that IT investments (1) were made to complement firm strategy for strategic advantage as well as due to strategic necessity, and (2) paid off by enhancing firm performance and addressing the issue of strategic necessity. In addition, our analysis reveals the simultaneous relationship between performance and IT investments: high-performing banking firms appear to have been more likely to invest in IT. The econometric analysis methods that we employ made it possible for us to state all of our quantitative findings for the FDIC data to be stated after adjusting for this endogeneity through simultaneity.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,2,9,40

Despite the competitive necessity of becoming a knowledge-based organization, senior managers have found it difficult to transform their firms through programs of knowledge management. This is particularly true if their organizations have long histories of process and a tradition of business success. This research examines the issue of effective knowledge management from the perspective of organizational capabilities. This perspective suggests that a knowledge infrastructure consisting of technology, structure, and culture along with a knowledge process architecture of acquisition, conversion, application, and protection are essential organizational capabilities or ""preconditions"" for effective knowledge management. Through analysis of surveys collected from over 300 senior executives, this research empirically models and uncovers key aspects of these dimensions.

Increasing business dynamics, changing customer preferences, and disruptive technological shifts pose the need for two kinds of flexibility that interenterprise information systems must address--the ability of interenterprise linkages to support changes in offering characteristics (offering flexibility) and the ability to alter linkages to partner with different supply chain players (partnering flexibility). This study explores how enterprises in supply chains may forge supply chain linkages that enable both types of flexibility jointly, and allow them to deal with ubiquitous change. Drawing on March and Simon's coordination theory, we propose two design principles: (1) advance structuring of interorganizational processes and Information exchange that allows partnering organizations to be loosely coupled, and (2) IT-supported dynamic adjustment that allows enterprises to quickly sense change and adapt their supply chain linkages. This study reports on a survey of 41 supply chain relationships in the IT industry. For design principle, our empirical investigation of factors shows (I) that modular design of interconnected processes and structured data connectivity are associated with higher supply chain flexibility, and (2) that deep coordination-related knowledge is critical for supply chain flexibility. Also, sharing a broad range of information with partners is detrimental to supply chain flexibility, and organizations should instead focus on improving the quality of information shared. For Industry managers, the study provides clear insights for information infrastructure design. To manage their interdependencies, enterprises need to encapsulate their interconnected processes in modular chunks, and support these with IT platforms for...",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,7,45

In the travel industry, electronic distribution has existed for decades via the global distribution systems (GDSs), reservation systems that were introduced in the early 1980s on mainframe platforms. Yet with the Internet, new digital intermediaries have threatened the viability of these legacy GDSs. We examine this transformation of e-travel distribution to test the theory of newly vulnerable markets, which predicts how markets become vulnerable to fundamental changes triggered by IT. The tenets of newly vulnerable markets theory are supported. The GDS market became newly easy to enter due to a decrease in barriers to entry caused by the Internet and other technologies, attractive to attack due to their out-of-date and inefficient pricing mechanisms, which made opportunistic pickoff possible across customer profitability gradients, and difficult to defend due to their lack of vision and strategic inflexibility.

We test two hypotheses: the decommoditization hypothesis and the resonance marketing hypothesis. We use data from an airline with a new Ã  la carte pricing mechanism, which allows consumers to tailor airline ticket bundles to suit their individual preferences. We compare Ã  la carte ticket pricing, whose features can be modified by the purchaser, and fixed (bundled offer) sales, which cannot be modified. We found that a significant number of travelers do use Ã  la carte pricing, which allows the airlines to regain some control over distribution. We find that travelers customized standard bundles when it was possible for them to make Ã  la carte ticket bookings, but mainly for low-feature standard bundles. Frequent-flyer members purchased higher-feature bundles more often when they had the opportunity. The findings support the proposed hypotheses.

This study investigates why technical support analysts seek out and access knowledge from these repositories, as opposed to more traditional sources of such knowledgeâ€”colleagues and manuals. Focusing on the demand forâ€”rather than supply ofâ€”knowledge in organizations, our research elaborates the role played by analysts' learning orientation, perceived work demands, and risk aversion in predicting their knowledge sourcing behavior. Our results include several counterintuitive findings that suggest there is not very much learning going on via technical support knowledge repositories. Analysts seem to be focused on finding recipes for solving customers' problems rather than building a better understanding of the products they support. Implications for research and practice highlight the need for more effective technologies to speed searches, the utility of a formal and visible mechanism for validating knowledge, and the inherent tension between efficiency and learning in these environments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,159,190

While numerous factors could affect a manager's use of a DSS, this paper reports the results of an experiment designed to measure two of them: type of training received and cognitive style. A controlled laboratory experiment with pretest and posttest measures was conducted using 63 managers to determine how the type of training and the cognitive styles of managers affected their use of a DSS generator. Analysis of the results shows that there is an interaction between cognitive style and type of training which affected the manager's initial use of a DSS generator.

If markets for IT services are local, then we should expect increases in local supply would increase the likelihood of outsourcing by lowering the cost of outsourcing. If markets are not local, then local supply will not affect outsourcing demand. We analyze the outsourcing decisions of a large sample of 99,775 establishments in 2002 and 2004, for two types of IT services--programming and design and hosting. Programming and design projects require communication of detailed user requirements whereas hosting requires less coordination between client and service provider than programming and design. Our empirical results bear out this intuition: the probability of outsourcing programming and design is increasing in the local supply of outsourcing, and this sensitivity to local supply conditions has been increasing over time. This suggests there is some nontradable or ""local"" component to programming and design services that cannot be easily removed. In contrast, the decision to outsource hosting is sensitive to local supply only for firms for which network uptime and security concerns are particularly acute.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,2,73,102

In spite of the intuitive appeal of these arguments, however, many firms find that the uncertainty of a solid, measurable payoff makes it hard to justify major investments. As a result, some managers have given up trying to evaluate the benefits of these systems, and they now make the investment decision ""on faith""â€”losing in the process any form of real accountability. By evaluating DSS and OA development projects in the aggregate, however, some of these justification problems can be minimized. While we may not be able to identify the specific benefits generated by an individual system, we can often measure the overall productivity improvements attributable to the portfolio of systems.

Integrative Complexity Theory provides the primary theoretical foundation, and an Information Overload Model for GSS is introduced. Results from a laboratory experiment provide support for the idea that effective GSS tools can be designed based on a theoretical understanding of information processing, in particular, how information is processed under conditions of high information load. Use of a GSS tool designed to regulate the flow of information, called an Idea Regulator, led subjects to organize ideas with higher levels of complexity, but they also reported higher levels of mental workload. This research suggests that particular attention to the problem of information overload, and research focused on finding theory-based solutions, can lead to more effective meetings.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,3,157,185

The diversity of these outsourcing arrangements goes well beyond that associated with the more traditional facilities management. This paper examines outsourcing trends and reports the results of an empirical study on IS outsourcing. Overall IS outsourcing and its five component functions namely, applications development, systems operations, telecommunications, end-user support, and systems planning and management--are examined for their relationships with outsourcing success. The effect of service quality of the provider and the ability of companies to build a partnership on these relationships are hypothesized and studied. Data from senior executives in 188 companies are gathered. Outsourcing success is found to be highly related to the degree of outsourcing of two functions, systems operations and telecommunications. The results indicate that transaction cost theory provides a good framework for IS outsourcing and that asset specificity of outsourcing transactions needs to be considered in any decision to outsource. Also, both service quality of the vendor and elements of partnership such as trust, cooperation, and communication are important for outsourcing success. Implications of the study for research and practice are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1996,4,89,116

A key emphasis of these interorganizational systems (IOS) is to improve the coordination between buyers and suppliers through electronic integration. While such IOS integration is purportedly good, because it tightens linkages in the supply chain, it is not clear whether it is the best configuration under all conditions. A review of literature on adoption and use of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems (a type of IOS) shows that this issue has been examined from multiple theoretic perspectives. Researchers have examined how contingencies related to technology, organization, and environment shape EDI use. Limited attention has been directed toward understanding how conditions under which transactions are conducted impact the use of IOS. We argue that transactional characteristics are important antecedents to IOS integration and propose that demand uncertainty, complexity, market fragmentation, and market volatility capture key characteristics. These factors coupled with an open information-sharing environment are hypothesized to influence IOS integration. Data collected from the electronics industry is used to examine the research model. Results show that firms tend to deploy integrated IOS when complexity of the component is high, market fragmentation is low, and an open information-sharing environment exists. Thus, from a managerial perspective, IOS integration is the appropriate configuration under conditions of high product complexity and open information-sharing environment, but it precludes the firm from participating in the open market and gaining brokerage benefits.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2007,4,185,216

Teng,The Implementation of Business Process Reengineering, business process reengineering;  change management;  implementation of innovations,"As more organizations undertake business process reengineering (BPR), issues in implementing BPR projects become a major concern. This field research seeks empirically to explore the problems of implementing reengineering projects and how the severity of these problems relates to BPR project success. Based on past theories and research related to the implementation of organizational change as well as field experience of reengineering experts, a comprehensive list of sixty-four BPR implementation problems was identified. The severity of each problem was then rated by those who have participated in reengineering in 105 organizations. Analysis of the results clearly demonstrates the central importance of change management in BPR implementation success. Resolutions of problems in other areas such as technological competence and project planning were also determined to be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for reengineering success. Further, problems that are more directly related to the conduct of a project such as process delineation, project management, and tactical planning were perceived as less difficult, yet highly related to project success. This situation was also true for human resource problems such as training personnel for the redesigned process. These findings suggest that reengineering project implementation is complex, involving many factors. To succeed, it is essential that change be managed and that balanced attention be paid to all identified factors, including those that are more contextual (e.g., management support and technological competence) as well as factors that pertain directly to the conduct of the project (e.g., project management and process delineation). As one of the first pieces of empirical evidence based on a field study, this research emphasizes the importance of addressing BPR implementation within the broader context of organizational change in a complex sociotechnical environment.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,1,109,144

Our research aims at improving decision makers' performance by (1) boosting their awareness to their emotional state and (2) improving their skills for effective emotion regulation. To that end, we designed and implemented a serious game-based NeuroIS tool that continuously displays the player's individual emotional state, via biofeedback, and adapts the difficulty of the decision environment to this emotional state. The design artifact was then evaluated in two laboratory experiments. Taken together, our study demonstrates how information systems design science research can contribute to improving financial decision making by integrating physiological data into information technology artifacts.

Our findings indicate that CIOs differ from manufacturing and sales executives in the relative importance they place on managerial roles. This difference does not exist between CIOs and finance executives or between CIOs and information systems (IS) middle managers. As IS management matures, the spokesman and liaison role of the ClO becomes more important. Surprisingly, as IS matures, the strategic responsibilities entitled in the monitor and entrepreneur roles of the ClO do not become more important. However, it was found that the more centralized the IS resource, the greater the CIO's role in acting as a spokesman, environmental monitor, and resource allocator. The results of this study have implications for management development, training, and the career planning of IS management.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,2,107,130

To remedy this situation, it is essential to develop new methodologies that facilitate the process of defining distinct decision parameters, understandable by the decision-maker, the analyst, and others in the organization. The primary purpose of this paper is to present and apply the Rep Test, a methodology for eliciting the information used, or desired to be used, by decision-makers. The information elicited and the salient characteristics decision-makers attach to this information are further analyzed and interpreted by examining the results of information sources scaled on information attributes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,1,1984,1,11,32

Consequently, numerous methods and tools are available supporting collaborative processes such as strategic planning, risk management, requirements definition, and so on. These methods typically emphasize the collaborative, value-creating activities, but there is often less emphasis on quality aspects. Quality assurance (QA) techniques have been well-known in engineering for a long time, and their effectiveness and efficiency has been empirically evaluated in many domains. In this paper, we propose to integrate repeatable QA techniques and collaborative processes. We evaluate our idea in the context of a collaborative process for requirements negotiation. We propose pre-process techniques to be used before the actual negotiation, in-process techniques for checking quality during a negotiation, as well as post-process inspection techniques. These techniques help a project team reduce unnecessary complexity and to mitigate risks stemming from defects in requirements negotiation results. We present the results of a feasibility study we conducted to test our approach.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2004,4,9,29

Three case studies with varying degrees of BPC project success are described in the context of this model, with the specific goal of determining facilitators and inhibitors to the success of these change efforts. The results indicate that the successful project tended to have facilitators in all dimensions of the framework, including the change environment, process management, and change management.

Our paper considers a firm that offers an information good through spot buying, forward buying at a reduced price, or a combination of the two. The time lag between forward buying and spot buying brings about an uncertainty in a consumer's reservation price for the good at the time of advance purchase. We propose a consumer decision-making model that captures this fundamental feature and provides interesting insights into the key elements of consumer behavior. We establish that a consumer offered the choice between forward buying and waiting to (possibly) buy the good on spot faces the trade-off between a lower unit price and the value of updated preferences. We also establish that consumers preferring forward buying have a relatively high expectation and low uncertainty in their reservation prices for the good at the time of advance purchase, while those preferring spot buying have a relatively low expectation and high uncertainty in their reservation prices for the good. We apply the model to formulate and analyze the firm's problem when it is either a price taker or a price setter. When the firm is a price taker, the choice is whether to offer the good for only forward buying, only spot buying, or a combination of the two. With an example, we show that when both the spot price and the discount on forward buying are moderate in values, the seller chooses the mixed strategy of offering both forward and spot buying simultaneously. When the firm is a price setter, the goal is to choose the offering(s) and the price level(s). With the example, we show how firms selling information goods can increase their revenues by using a mixed offering strategy with both spot and forward offerings. This strategy lends itself to second-degree price discrimination by the seller when there are groups of customers potentially heterogeneous",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,2,107,131

This is even more so when viewed through the lens of the net neutrality debate, since the vertically integrated firm can prioritize the delivery of its own content at the expense of that of its competitors if net neutrality is not enforced. Using a game-theoretic model, we analyze the issues of vertical integration of content and broadband services surrounding this debate from an economic perspective. Our analysis establishes the various equilibria in the game and shows that the vertically integrated BSP does not have any incentive to abide by the principles of net neutrality. If net neutrality is not enforced, social welfare might, in certain cases, decrease with vertical integration, and in such cases, the BSP's objectives are at odds with that of the social planner. With other ranges of parameter values, social welfare increases with vertical integration at the expense of the competing pure-play content provider. Interestingly, we find that it is not always true that the BSP will always degrade the delivery of the competing content, and in fact will sometimes have the incentive to prioritize the latter over its own. The analysis thus provides crucial inputs to policymakers as they decide on whether to allow vertical integration between a BSP and a content provider in the absence of net neutrality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,243,275

They often knowingly engage in certain insecure uses of IS and violate security policies without malicious intentions. Few studies, however, have examined end user motivation to engage in such behavior. To fill this research gap, in the present study we propose and test empirically a nonmalicious security violation (NMSV) model with data from a survey of end users at work. The results suggest that utilitarian outcomes (relative advantage for job performance, perceived security risk), normative outcomes (workgroup norms), and self-identity outcomes (perceived identity match) are key determinants of end user intentions to engage in NMSVs. In contrast, the influences of attitudes toward security policy and perceived sanctions are not significant. This study makes several significant contributions to research on security-related behavior by (1) highlighting the importance of job performance goals and security risk perceptions on shaping user attitudes, (2) demonstrating the effect of workgroup norms on both user attitudes and behavioral intentions, (3) introducing and testing the effect of perceived identity match on user attitudes and behavioral intentions, and (4) identifying nonlinear relationships between constructs. This study also informs security management practices on the importance of linking security and business objectives, obtaining user buy-in of security measures, and cultivating a culture of secure behavior at local workgroup levels in organizations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,203,236

Individual blog traffic and blogosphere structure are of interest to academia and practice. Although it is difficult to get a snapshot of the blogosphere with enough blogs over a long enough period to capture the real situation, chaos theory finds underlying order in this apparent random and complex phenomenon. This study provides an overall view of blogging from micro (individual blog traffic dynamics) and macro (blogosphere structure) levels through a chaos theory lens. Key concepts of chaos theory are used to construct an interpretive framework to illustrate blog system behavior dynamics. Blog systems tend to be nonlinear, dynamic, and deterministic, as well as sensitive to initial conditions. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of applying chaos theory thinking to areas such as knowledge management and the recent global financial crisis.

Pricing approaches based on negative externality have potential to address the issue of congestion. However, most externality-based pricing approaches require the knowledge of consumers' private demand characteristics, and this requirement is often pointed out as the single most important shortcoming of these mechanisms. The fact that the Internet is a ""public good"" presents challenging information extraction problems for network managers in implementing any pricing mechanism. Ideally, we seek an incentive-compatible mechanism--a means of extracting the required information that provides no incentives for users to alter their behavior in an attempt to manipulate the information extraction and price setting processes. The authors present a solution based on a new nonparametric statistical technique that was developed for this purpose. While the results in this paper are presented in the context of our prior research on pricing, the approach presented here applies to information extraction and implementation in other resource pricing approaches.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,1,9,29

EBPP continues to grow and will become a multi-billion dollar e-commerce industry. The technology adoption configuration in this context is quite interesting because it involves four stakeholders: billers, bill consolidators, banks, and consumers. Banks and bill consolidators compete to act as an intermediary between billers and consumers. Network externalities play a significant role: the more billers that adopt the technology, the more consumers are willing to use the services. Our analysis is based on the welfare economics concept of finding the socially optimum adoption configuration and the resulting adoption pattern in a market with sponsored technologies. The results show that due to network externalities, billers are more likely to adopt the existing technology early, though the next technology might be superior to the current one. When the higher costs of early adoption are taken into account, the model shows that billers are more willing to wait, ceteris paribus. Our results also show that anticipation of a new and better, but compatible, technology might cause billers to wait, depending on what benefits they expect by adopting early, and how much cost they anticipate to incur upgrading their technology later.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,2,47,63

Moreover, recent discussions of human-computer collaborative work have highlighted the system performance advantages of this interchange. In this paper, the notion of human-computer interchange protocols is developed and the importance of these protocols to human-computer collaboration and system performance is argued. Based on data collected in a laboratory setting, empirical support for the proposed holistic effect of human-computer interchange protocols on system performance is provided.

The aim of this study is to derive a prescriptive architecture for crisis response systems, in particular, the role of communication and the characteristics of communication systems that are needed to connect the decision-making elements of crisis response. The layered crisis communication architecture (CCA) detailed in this paper enumerates the communication functionality required of any crisis response system. To support the crisis-handling team adequately during crisis response, such systems must include the services of each of the described six layers: The base, or connectivity, layer interfaces with the ISO's OSI model to provide error-free end-to-end message transfer. The data-validation layer protects against incorrect data sources through gathering information to corroborate an incoming message. The filtering layer organizes and synthesizes messages to ensure that the crisis-handling team is presented with relevant data in a meaningful, usable form. The values layer interprets messages based on preestablished crisis priorities. The organizational memory layer provides decision makers with access to relevant data and knowledge bases. The group process layer supports the communication, coordination, and collaboration among the crisis-handling team members. To support crisis response adequately, these six layers of the CCA must be implemented as a single, cohesive whole. Through the CCA, the study offers pragmatically sound principles for organizing crisis response systems and captures a comprehensive perspective of the crisis response process; that is, this work offers a system architecture. As an architecture, the model enumerates all the functions necessary to support crisis response communication effectively.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,1,235,255

We employed fixed-effects logistical regressions to examine publicly available data for 51 firms that announced their decisions to outsource all or a large portion of their IT function during the 1993-2001 period. Results suggest that incentives created by CEO stock options and overall compensation mix significantly influence decisions to outsource. We thus provide the first evidence of a relationship between managerial self-interest and IT outsourcing. Additional results suggest that poor overall firm performance, poor cost control, and short-term cash needs also drive large-scale IT outsourcing, but provide no evidence that firms outsource IT to reduce leverage. Overall, we conclude that CEOs consider several personal and firm-level financial factors, including factors unrelated to IT cost and performance, when making large-scale IT outsourcing decisions.

This paper examines factors that are associated with the extent to which IT product companies are able to develop service revenue, which we refer to as service expansion of IT product companies. We identify the characteristics of the product portfolio-specifically, the composition and scope of firm offerings among hardware, application software, and infrastructure software-as key to successful service expansion. We also propose that this relationship is moderated by prior performance of the product business and industry characteristics such as concentration and maturity. Data from IT product vendors spanning five years are used to test the proposed relationships. Overall, this research provides a theoretical foundation for understanding service expansion and diversification in the IT industry as well as practical guidance for IT product companies considering expansion to services.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,127,158

This typically entails substantial behavioral change by software developers away from previous informal practices toward conformance with the methodology. Developers' resistance to such change often results in failure to fully deploy and realize the benefits of the methodology. The present research draws upon theories of intention formation and innovation diffusion to advance knowledge about why developers accept or resist following methodologies. Results from a field study within a large organization indicate that developers' intentions are directly influenced by their perceptions of usefulness, social pressure, compatibility, and organizational mandate. This pattern of intention determinants is quite different from that typically observed in studies of information technology tool adoption, revealing several key differences between the domains of tool versus methodology adoption. Specifically, although organizational mandate had a significant effect on intentions, the strength of its direct influence was the lowest among the four significant constructs, and usefulness, compatibility, and social pressure all influenced intentions directly, above and beyond the effects of organizational mandate. The findings suggest, contrary to popular belief, that an organizational mandate is not sufficient to guarantee use of the methodology in a sustained manner.

A multiple regression analysis showed that the male gender, younger age, more experience with computers, an attitude of confidence regarding computers, lower math anxiety, and a creative cognitive style are individual difference variables associated with higher computer skill. The regression also indicated that the individual difference variables accounted for 56 percent of the variance associated with computer skill.

This preliminary investigation tests a theoretical framework relating two pivotal themes, power and trust, to the use of electronic data interchange (EDI). Separate models were tested incorporating two dimensions of EDI use: volume of transactions and diversity of EDI transaction sets. The relationships among supplier dependence, customer power, and EDI use were different for volume and diversity, suggesting unique conditions that predict each dimension. Interestingly, power was negatively related to the volume of EDI transactions indicating that, while electronic networks may facilitate easier exchanges, they may not necessarily lead to increases in the frequency of exchanges. The relationships among commitment, trust, and EDI use were also different for volume and diversity. Trust was related to diversity but not volume. Moreover, trust was related to increases in diversity of EDI use, in contrast to power, which was negatively related to diversity. This latter finding may offer an important prescription for managers who seek to expand the effective use of EDI and for IT researchers who need to focus on the role of trust in supporting information exchange between electronic partners.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1998,4,87,111

Despite the fact that rationality is commonly assumed in economic analyses, the REH's assumptions make it a unique theory and allow us to offer new perspectives on IS/IT adoption and investment decision-making. Our application of these theoretical perspectives to the IT adoption context---the first time in the IS literature to our knowledge that REH has been used to examine the mechanism for business value expectations formation---will allow us to treat the investment and adoption issues using a perspective that is based on a longer time horizon. Such settings require managers, as economic agents, to form a set of expectations about the values of various variables related to the business value of IT. Rational expectations and adaptive learning assume that decision-makers are able to utilize all available decision-relevant information efficiently and can learn the true value of a prospective investment over time. We present a number of propositions that characterize this perspective, and discuss some illustrative examples that demonstrate the efficacy of the theoretical perspective that we present to characterize the business value expectations formation process in IT adoption.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,2,49,76

Group work studies have shown that gesturing makes up over 35 percent of all interactions. Participants use hand gestures to enact ideas, to focus the attention of the group, to signal turn-taking, and to reference objects on the work surface. Specifically, this paper explores gesturing as applied to users of group support systems. We address practical issues such as: at what level of interaction might gesturing be supported, how large and what shape should gesture pointers be, how they should move, network and processor throughput requirements, and group size effects. Our results show that while full motion computer gesturing can be supported on PC-LAN systems for small groups, gesturing for medium and large groups requires the use of special techniques such as regulating transmission rates, motion smoothing, and point and quiver cursors. These techniques could also be applied to wide area network implementations to reduce network traffic and latency problems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,3,43,61

Hypotheses are developed and tested about the influences of comment length, comment evaluative tone, duration of group membership, and prior communication among group members on the accuracy of attributions they made about the identity of the authors of these technically anonymous comments. Data on prior communication and group history about each of the 32 small groups was collected before participants began using a GSS for brainstorming. Immediately after the session, each member was asked to attribute authorship to a sample of the session's anonymous comments (comment authorship was known to the researchers). The study's participants made attributions that were significantly more accurate than chance guessing. Factors that had a positive influence on attribution accuracy include evaluative tone of comments (especially humorous comments) and amount of prior communication received from other group members. Vividness of comment tone and comment length was not significantly correlated with attribution accuracy. Although the attributions of anonymous comments were more accurate than expected by chance, most of the attributions were incorrect. Implications and consequences of both accurate and inaccurate attribution are discussed along with suggestions for future research. ",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,1,301,329

Researchers have investigated knowledge management factors such as enablers, processes, and performance. However, most current empirical research has explored the relationships between these factors in isolation. To fill this gap, this paper develops a research model that interconnects knowledge management factors. The model includes seven enablers: collaboration, trust, learning, centralization, formalization, T-shaped skills, and information technology support. The emphasis is on knowledge creation processes such as socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization. To establish credibility between knowledge creation and performance, organizational creativity is incorporated into the model. Surveys collected from 58 firms were analyzed to test the model. The results confirmed the impact of trust on knowledge creation. The information technology support had a positive impact on knowledge combination only. Organizational creativity was found to be critical for improving performance; neglecting ideas can undermine a business. The results may be used as a stepping stone for further empirical research and can help formulate robust strategies that involve trade-offs between knowledge management enablers.

When implementing such techniques with GSS, choices must be made regarding how to configure the GSS to deploy the initial creative stimuli and to present the pool of emerging ideas that act as additional stimuli. This paper reports the results of an experiment that compares Electronic Brainstorming (few unnamed rotating dialogues) with Assumption Reversals (many related stimuli, many named dialogues, free movement among dialogues) and Analogies (many unrelated stimuli, many named dialogues, free movement among dialogues). Analogies produced creative, but fewer, ideas, due to the use of unrelated stimuli. Assumption Reversals produced the most, but less creative, ideas, possibly due to fragmentation of the group memory and cognitive inertia caused by lack of forced movement among dialogues.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2002,4,59,85

Lentz,"Learning, Working, and Innovation: A Case Study in the Insurance Industry", organizational innovation;  organizational learning;  value management in organizations,"The worldwide environment in which strategic information technology (IT) initiatives are deployed is changing. Increasingly, these IT investments are intended to produce not only internal operating efficiencies and cost savings but also external market outcomes. The linkage between IT investments and business value is critical in the service sector for industries, such as financial services, transportation, and retailing, where IT is an integral part of the products and services delivered to customers. Using case study research data from six large North American companies and recent theory as our guide, this paper identifies ways in which information systems (IS) organizations can become more innovative by using learning as the bridge between working and innovation. To illustrate the findings, we present data from a case study at Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, a large, multinational North American insurance company.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,3,43,64

Emerging research in the economics of information security has suggested real options analysis (ROA) as a potential technique for assessing the value of information security assets, but has focused primarily on the most effective level of investment and the configuration of intrusion prevention/detection systems. In this paper, we attempt to address significant gaps in the literature by developing an integrated real options model for information security investments using Bayesian statistics that incorporates learning and postauditing in the analysis. By using the proposed model with actual data on e-mail and spam, we demonstrate that ROA with Bayesian postauditing offers a systematic valuation and risk management framework for evaluating information security spending by firms. We also discuss the managerial implications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,337,375

An experiment is conducted that examines the effect that increased levels of vividness (text, voice, and animation) and decision aid personality have on decision-making involvement. In addition, the influence of two individual differences, gender and computer playfulness, on decision aid involvement are investigated. The cost-benefit framework of decision making and related research on consumer information processing provide the theoretical foundation for the study and suggest how increased involvement may influence decision making. Several decision-making outcomes are measured, including decision effort, decision quality, satisfaction with the decision aid, and understanding of the decision aid. Findings indicate that personality similarity (between the user and the decision aid) and computer playfulness result in increased involvement with the decision aid. In addition, women report higher levels of involvement with the decision aid. Increased levels of multimedia vividness are found to have a contradictory effect, with animation actually reducing involvement with the decision aid. The findings are discussed in terms of theoretical contributions and practical interface design implications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,15,54

To encourage online commerce, many online retailers use online word-of-mouth systems, where consumers can rate products offered for sale. To date, how such ratings affect trust and adoption of e-commerce across genders has been relatively unexplored. We assess whether the effect of online trust on intention to shop online is moderated by gender. Our results show that the effect of trust on intention to shop online is stronger for women than for men. In addition, we find that men value their ability to post content online, whereas women value the responsive participation of other consumers to the content they have posted. Finally, we find that online word-of-mouth quality affects online trust differently across genders.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2008,4,101,121

Many papers have been written that promulgate specific elicitation methods. A few model elicitation in general. However, none have yet modeled elicitation in a way that makes clear the critical role played by situational knowledge. This paper presents a unified model of the requirements elicitation process that emphasizes the iterative nature of elicitation as it transforms the current state of the requirements and the situation to an improved understanding of the requirements and, potentially, a modified situation. One meta-process of requirements elicitation, selection of an appropriate elicitation technique, is also captured in the model. The values of this model are: (1) an improved understanding of elicitation helps analysts improve their elicitation efforts and (2) as we improve our ability to perform elicitation, we improve the likelihood that systems we create will meet their intended customers' needs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2004,4,65,84

However, the additional information does not often lead to better group decisions, probably because individuals fail to process the new information they receive. This study explored the use of groupware processes that required individuals in groups to categorize information, in order to induce group members to better attend to the new information received from others and to integrate it into their own individual decision-making processes. Different groupware processes had different effects on attention to and integration of information, and ultimately on decision quality. Groupware processes that provided categories to organize information and groupware processes that required the receiver of information to categorize information increased attention to information and integration of information, which led to improved individual decision quality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,3,93,114

Yet few studies empirically examine the existence and drivers of this long tail phenomenon. This study uses a unique data set with 843,922 purchases from 143,939 customers that a monopolistic video-on-demand operator observed over 111 weeks after its launch of the service. The current analysis centers on the effects of increasing assortment sizes and improved search technologies on measures of the long tail, such as per customer demand, the share of products purchased from the assortment, the distribution of demand across products, and the concentration of demand. Increases in assortment sizes and better assortment quality lead to increases in demand per customer and a longer tail. The length of the tail (i.e., share of purchased products) is also driven by new customers and seasonal effects, such as school vacations, whereas the presence of high-quality blockbuster products shortens the tail. Different search technologies can shift demand toward niche products as well as toward blockbuster products.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,43,69

Although the business value of ERP implementations has been extensively debated in trade periodicals in the form of qualitative discussion or detailed case studies, there is little large-sample statistical evidence on whether the benefits of ERP implementation exceed the costs and risks. With multiyear multi-firm ERP implementation and financial data, we find that firms that invest in ERP tend to show higher performance across a wide variety of financial metrics. Even though there is a slowdown in business performance and productivity shortly after the implementation, financial markets consistently reward the adopters with higher market valuation (as measured by Tobin's q). Due to the lack of mid- and long-term post-implementation data, future research on the long-run impact of ERP is proposed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,1,71,98

Although successful implementation of electronic marketplaces may be found in several industries, some systems have failed or their penetration pace is slower than was projected, indicating that significant bathers remain. This paper analyzes the economic forces and barriers behind the electronic market adoptions from the perspective of market process reengineering. Four cases of electronic market adoption--two successful and two failed--are used for this analysis. Economic benefits are examined by investigating how the market process innovation enabled by information technology (IT) reduces transaction costs and increases market efficiency. Adoption barriers are identified by analyzing transaction risks and resistance resulting from the reengineering. Successful deployment of electronic market systems requires taking into account these barriers along with the economic benefits of adoption. The paper presents suggestions based on these case studies, which are relevant to the analysis, design, and implementation of electronic market systems by market-making firms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,3,113,136

A controlled experiment that varied the form of decision support (no support, manual structure support equivalent to the GDSS structure, and GDSS support) and elected leadership (yes and no) was used to compare group decisions. Forty-eight undergraduate student groups were randomly assigned to one of the six treatment conditions of this 3x2 factorial design. The groups solved a preference task that required resolution of competing preference structures to arrive at group decisions. The level of premeeting consensus was used as a covariate. The dependent measures included postmeeting consensus, equality of influence, and influence of the leader. The major findings of this research are: â€¢ Manual groups displayed a significantly higher postmeeting consensus than GDSS groups. Elected leadership did not increase postmeeting consensus. â€¢ There was a significant correlation between equality of influence and premeeting consensus in GDSS groups. Groups that had high premeeting consensus seemed willing to let one member dominate the final solution. â€¢ Group support in the form of structure has potential to undermine leadership in small group meetings because leaders in manual and GDSS groups appeared to be less influential than their counterparts in baseline groups.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,2,109,133

It reviews the current literature on information-technology-enabled organizational transformation to identify key variables for measuring organizational change. It employs the case research method to examine TradeNet, a well-established EDI system in Singapore. It discusses how the Trade Development Board (TDB) of Singapore has taken advantage of the TradeNet opportunity to drastically transform its own organizational structure, business processes, business network, and business scope. The organizational transformation that accompanied TradeNet implementation resulted in significant gains for both the public and the private sector in Singapore. TDB and other public-sector organizations gained in terms of increased productivity in carrying out their organizational functions. The trading community, comprising the private-sector organizations, benefited in terms of increased competitiveness. Change-point analyses carried out on annual organizational and performance figures confirmed the productivity increases at TDB. Analyses of the results of questionnaires administered to TradeNet participants confirmed the increased competitiveness experienced by the trading community. Noteworthy lessons from this study, important for EDI implementation, are a willingness to change existing mindset, to institute radical transformation, to leverage knowledge and technology, and to foster win-win situations. This study demonstrates that the use of IT, or EDI in particular, for organizational transformation could lead to phenomenal gains.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1997,4,139,165

Our work is among the first to carefully study and analyze the impact of enterprise information systems at a large-scale service organization that produces intangible outputs--health. It extends the literature on information economics by quantifying the benefits in process dynamics as a source of ongoing firm-level performance improvements. The key dimensions of measurements include financial revenues, operating lead times, and subjective satisfaction levels by the clinical staff and by the referring physicians. Analyses of longitudinal data suggest that performance levels along a key metric--clinical process lead time--showed a significant improvement immediately after the deployment and integration of the systems. The evidence reveals that performance kept improving for the following 12 months at an impressive learning rate of 63 percent. Moreover, the reported satisfaction level after installation was higher among referring physicians who actively used the full spectrum of technological functionalities at their own clinics or at the hospital's site. Finally, we present a general framework for capturing the actual tangible and intangible benefits of enterprise information systems installation and integration in a clinical context.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,43,68

Meanwhile, database creators have been seeking legal protection for their data, such as the European Union's Database Directive. The legislative development shows that there is significant difficulty in finding the right balance between protecting the incentives of creating publicly accessible databases (including semistructured Web sites) and preserving adequate access to factual data for value-creating activities. We address this issue using an extended spatial competition model that explicitly considers licensing provisions and inefficiencies in policy administration. The results show that, depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, there are different socially beneficial policy choices, such as protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory licensing, discouraging voluntary licensing, or even allowing free riding. With the appropriate policy in place, both the creators and the reusers should focus on innovation that can increase the variety of databases and create value from database contents.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,199,232

We compared small groups writing managerial memoranda in a computer-supported meeting room, and with conventional writing tools. The computer environment, the Capture Lab, allowed us to study how a technology designed for broad functionality and flexibility in group process affects collaborative work. We find that the technology alters the writing process, resulting in less initial group planning, more individual work, and more revising than when conventional tools are used. This affects negotiation and consensus-reaching processes. The technology also reduces speech and group focus. User feedback suggests the technology has both positive and negative effects on group interaction. The technology did not affect overall document quality, although one measure suggests it can enhance writers' audience adaptiveness. Comparisons of how different groups used the technology suggest that these patterns influence document quality. In the conclusion, we discuss what groups need in order to use this kind of collaborative technology effectively and future research directions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,3,27,48

The challenge confronting software vendors and consumers is understanding the balance between the need to inform the market and the negative consequences of unfulfilled promises. Based on signaling theory from marketing science and research, this study looks at the perceived importance of software preannouncement factors on customers, of unfulfilled promises and unreliable software on a company's reputation, and whether vendor dependence changes these perceptions. Database administrators were surveyed on the perceptions of their database software vendor. Fulfilling commitments to software functionality was more strongly correlated with vendor reputation than on-time delivery of the software. Customer dependence on the vendor was not correlated with perceptions of vendor reputation and credibility. Thus, unlike other industries, it seems that vendors can use software delivery time preannouncements for competitive purposes with minimal concern for the impact on customers, provided the software ultimately delivers the features and functionality promised and is largely free of errors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,1,115,139

In the 1980s, knowledge-based techniques also have made an impressive contribution to ""intelligent"" information retrieval and indexing. More recently, information science researchers have turned to other, newer artificial intelligence-based inductive learning techniques including neural networks, symbolic learning, and genetic algorithms. The newer techniques have provided great opportunities for researchers to experiment with diverse paradigms for effective information processing and retrieval. In this article we first provide an overview of newer techniques and their usage in information science research. We then present in detail the algorithms we adopted for a hybrid Genetic Algorithms and Neural Nets based system, called GANNET. GANNET performed concept (keyword) optimization for user-selected documents during information retrieval using the genetic algorithms. It then used the optimized concepts to perform concept exploration in a large network of related concepts through the Hopfield net parallel relaxation procedure. Based on a test collection of about 3,000 articles from DIALOG and an automatically created thesaurus, and using Jaccard's score as a performance measure, our experiment showed that GANNET improved the Jaccard's scores by about 50 percent and it helped identify the underlying concepts (keywords) that best describe the user-selected documents.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,3,7,41

The results of the hierarchical linear modeling indicate that the individual-level virtuality (use of personal and communal communication technologies) significantly influences one's intra-group tie strength and extra-group network range. Moreover, the results show that the effects of individual-level virtuality on social networks vary depending on the group-level virtuality, such as geographic/temporal dispersion and technological support.

While such acceptance has received fairly extensive attention from previous research, additional efforts are needed to examine or validate existing research results, particularly those involving different technologies, user populations, and/or organizational contexts. In response, this paper reports a research work that examined the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in explaining physicians' decisions to accept telemedicine technology in the health-care context. The technology, the user group, and the organizational context are all new to IT acceptance/adoption research. The study also addressed a pragmatic technology management need resulting from millions of dollars invested by healthcare organizations in developing and implementing telemedicine programs in recent years. The model's overall fit, explanatory power, and the individual causal links that it postulates were evaluated by examining the acceptance of telemedicine technology among physicians practicing at public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. The authors' results suggested that TAM was able to provide a reasonable depiction of physicians' intention to use telemedicine technology. Perceived usefulness was found to be a significant determinant of attitude and intention but perceived ease of use was not. The relatively low R-square of the model suggests both the limitations of the parsimonious model and the need for incorporating additional factors or integrating with other IT acceptance models in order to improve its specificity and explanatory utility in a health-care context. Based on the study findings, implications for user technology acceptance research and telemedicine management are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,2,91,112

The results of our first experiment support the proposition by revealing that the two matching conditions, (1) attribute-based reviews describing a search product and (2) experience-based reviews describing an experience product, could lead consumers to perceive higher review helpfulness and lower cognitive effort (subjective measure) to comprehend the reviews. However, the subjective evaluation of cognitive effort is not reinforced by the resulting review comprehension time (an objective assessment of comprehension effort), which suggests that consumers spend significantly more time processing reviews in the presence of the two matching conditions. A second experiment was conducted using the think-aloud method to gain further insights into the effects. We found that under the review-product matching conditions, consumers engage in deeper-level comprehension and expend more time in comprehension without realizing it, compared to consumers under the mismatching conditions. This research extends our current understanding of how review content and product reviews jointly influence the comprehension and assessment behavior of the consumer, and provides guidelines on the identification and the presentation of reviews to facilitate the judgment and decision making of potential consumers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,3,311,343

Most previous GSS research has focused on studying group outcomes, whereas the current research studies group interaction processes using two different coding methods. A conceptual research model is derived from the Theory of Time, Interaction and Performance (TIP theory) and a review of the literature on social psychology and GSS. Task and social interactions are studied from an influence perspective. The task type is varied as preference task and intellective task. The support level is varied in a GSS support and non-GSS support (i.e., face-to-face) discussion. Research results report that GSS could significantly influence group interaction processes, and tend to enhance group task interactions but dampen group social interactions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,2,181,206

Our analysis identifies four distinct process patterns that explain this formation as the outcome of interaction processes between key elements of both contractual and relational governance. These patterns unveil the dynamic nature of complementarity and substitution. In particular, we show that the relationship between contractual and relational governance oscillates between complementarity and substitution. Those oscillations are triggered mainly by three types of contextual events (goal fuzziness, goal conflict, and goal misalignment). Surprisingly, substitution of informal control did not occur as an immediate reaction to external events but emerged as a consequence of preceding complementarity. Thus, our study challenges the prevailing view of an either/or dichotomy of complementarity and substitution by showing that they are causally connected over time.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,3,81,114

A solution for many researchers is to use students in controlled laboratory settings as surrogates for real-world decision makers. This practice is often questioned in many business and social sciences disciplines. Research results from attitudinal studies suggest that students' attitudes are not the same as those for whom they are surrogates. Still, some research demonstrates that students and nonstudents respond similarly during decision making. This paper contains the results of an experiment to decide if students and industry decision makers made decisions similarly before and following a training program in the use of a DSS generator. Our analysis of the results suggests that students were not adequate surrogates for industry managers in the decision-making process. Consequently, we dispute the claim that students and nonstudents unequivocally perform similarly during decision making.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,2,153,166

To meet these security standards, some organizations outsource security protection to a managed security service provider (MSSP). However, this may give rise to system interdependency risks. This paper analyzes how such system interdependency risks interact with a mandatory security requirement to affect the equilibrium behaviors of an MSSP and its clients. We show that a mandatory security requirement will increase the MSSP's effort and motivate it to serve more clients. Although more clients can benefit from the MSSP's protection, they are also subjected to greater system interdependency risks. Social welfare will decrease if the mandatory security requirement is high, and imposing verifiability may exacerbate social welfare losses. Our results imply that recent initiatives such as issuing certification to enforce computer security protection, or encouraging auditing of managed security services, may not be advisable.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,117,156

However, how many versions should be offered is not as clear. Classical pricing studies suggest providing as many versions as the number of customer types, whereas some studies in information systems suggest providing only one or two versions. In reality, firms typically provide more than one or two versions, such as three in the case of Goldilocks pricing. This study explains the discrepancies in these results and observations by showing that, although profit increases with more versions, the marginal benefit of an additional version decreases rapidly. Therefore, firms sell few versions even in the presence of very small versioning-related costs such as menu and cognitive costs. This study analyzes the effects of these costs, and shows that cognitive costs have more profound effects on versioning than menu costs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,167,191

Past research has applied correlation analysis techniques to explore correspondences between attributes. These techniques, however, are appropriate for numeric attributes that are linearly related. This paper proposes an information-theoretic approach to exploring correspondences between attributes in heterogeneous databases. The proposed approach is applicable to character attributes, as well as to numeric attributes, regardless whether or not they are linearly related. It overcomes some serious shortcomings of previous approaches based on correlation analysis and has much broader applicability. The proposed procedure samples both matching and nonmatching pairs of records from the databases under consideration, applies matching functions to compare pairs of attributes, and then uses the mutual information to measure the dependency between a matching function as applied to a pair of attributes and the class (i.e., matching or nonmatching) of a pair of records. A high mutual information index implies a potential attribute correspondence, which is presented to the analyst for further evaluation. The paper also presents some empirical results demonstrating the utility of the proposed approach.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2006,4,305,336

First, a framework for analysis based on the concept of fit is proposed. Three generic archetypes for three levels of ambitions are defined. Archetypes or ideal-type patterns of change are consistent packages of design and change management measures. It is hypothesized that organizations that change according to an ideal-type pattern outperform organizations that follow a different, inconsistent pattern. On the basis of a questionnaire sent to organizations involved in reengineering, this paper shows that consistent reengineering endeavors generally result in greater benefits than do inconsistent change efforts. It also demonstrates that only a minority of organizations have succeeded in creating a ""magical mix"" between the level of ambition and the design and change management measures actually taken. Finally, the managerial implications and future research challenges are described.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,1,93,118

However, while some firms' entire business models revolve around this initiative, others have made only limited commitments to online channel ventures. What accounts for these marked differences in commitment to online initiatives, and do firms reap the performance benefits of increased levels of commitment? Furthermore, how do firms' internal and external capabilities affect their propensity to establish and succeed with online channel ventures? Drawing on marketing, innovation, and information systems perspectives, along with insights from the resource-based view of the firm, we propose an integrative conceptual framework that helps answer these questions. We ground our hypotheses in the context of retailers' online channel development efforts, and test our conceptual framework with data collected via a Web-based survey of 550 retailers. We find evidence of significant positive returns to investments in online channels. Furthermore, we observe the divergent effects of different sets of capabilities on commitment and performance. Importantly, although we find that the direct effect of firms' information systems capabilities on online performance appears to be negative, the indirect effect (mediated by commitment) is positive. Our study also examines the impact of firms' established distribution channels on levels of commitment to, and performance of, the online channel. We find that firms' established distribution channels act as double-edged swords, with divergent effects on commitment and performance. We also find evidence of diminishing returns to commitment as a function of established distribution presence, thereby suggesting that the rewards of commitment do not accrue equally to all firms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2007,4,109,142

The Career Orientations Inventory is a questionnaire designed to assess an individual's career interests, career values, and career motivators. The measure evaluates nine career orientations: technical, managerial, autonomy, job security, geographic security, service, pure challenge, life-style, and entrepreneurship. A short form of this questionnaire was derived and tested in two separate field studies of IS employees. Extensive evidence of the reliability and validity of the measure was demonstrated in both studies (the development, Study 1, and the validation, Study 2). The relationships between career orientations and various individual difference and satisfaction measures were also tested and provided additional evidence of the construct validity of the short-form measure.

This study explores the antecedents and consequences of job satisfaction for IC employees. Five components of job satisfactionâ€”work, supervision, coworkers, pay, and promotionâ€”were examined besides overall job satisfaction. Two stress variablesâ€”role ambiguity and role conflictâ€”were considered as antecedents to satisfaction. Organizational commitment and intention to leave the organization were considered as outcomes from job satisfaction. The study also assessed the importance of personal characteristics as moderating variables to the relationship between the two role stressors and job satisfaction. Results show that role ambiguity was the most dysfunctional variable for IC employees in relation to job satisfaction. Organizational tenure was found to moderate the relationships between role stressors and overall job satisfaction, and some of its components. In addition, the relationship between role ambiguity and some components of job satisfaction were found to be education- and age-dependent. Results also confirmed the importance of job satisfaction in predicting organizational commitment and intention to leave. Implications for IC management and future research are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1993,4,145,174

This paper addresses this need by exploring whether turnover intentions and their determinants differ for telecommuters and non-telecommuters. Four hundred salespeople from one large company in the southeastern United States were asked to participate in the study. The organization entry point was the marketing director. One hundred and four telecommuting employees and one hundred and twenty-one regular employees responded, with a total of 225 usable questionnaires. Telecommuters seemed to face less role conflict and role ambiguity and tended to be happier with their supervisors and more committed to their organizations. They also showed lower satisfaction with peers and with promotion. Based on the results, recommendations are proposed for managing the implementation of telecommuting programs and their impact on the rest of the organization's employee population.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,1,147,164

This study used the technology acceptance model and sought to extend it by investigating the impact of the external factors (i.e., individual, organizational, and system characteristics) on the user acceptance of microcomputer technology. The paper reports the results of a field study investigating the determinants of microcomputer usage. The analyses of the measurement model confirm the existence of two distinct constructs of (1) beliefs-perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; (2) organizational support-management support and end-user computing (EUC) support; and (3) microcomputer usage-perceived usage and variety of use. The tested conceptual model confirms the effects of individual, organizational, and system characteristics on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The model also confirms the influence of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness, and the effects of perceived usefulness on perceived usage and variety of use. Results confirm several previously proposed notions, including the effects of individual, organizational, and system characteristics on ease of use and usefulness; the influence of ease of use on usefulness, and the effects of perceived usefulness on usage and variety of use. The results demonstrate the utility of investigating factors contributing to microcomputer usage and the external factors affecting endogenous variables such as system usefulness. The importance of EUC support and management support is corroborated, as well as the need for designing mechanisms such as training programs and newsletters to improve user perceptions of microcomputers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1995,4,87,114

Results provided substantial support for the proposition that perceived usefulness (rather than perceived fun or social pressure) is the principal motivator. The findings also demonstrated that perceived complexity is a key intervening variable linking the antecedent variables (skills, organizational support, and organizational usage) with the three motivational variables. The results also suggested that skills play a critical role in affecting microcomputer usage. Skills directly promote microcomputer usage and influence usage through their effects on perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and social pressure. The findings of the study contribute to an expanded understanding of the factors that promote microcomputer usage and also have important implications for the management of information systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,1,127,143

Still, OO technology is not yet fully understood and utilized by information systems (IS) organizations. Despite the growing interest and attention of the IS researchers and practitioners, empirical research on the assimilation process of OO technology has been limited. The present study assesses the current status of OO technology assimilation in IS organizations and identifies the factors influencing such assimilation from a software process innovation perspective. Innovation attributes and organizational characteristics were tested as determinants of the organizational OO technology assimilation based on a survey of 220 organizations. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationships of innovation and organizational variables with the level of OO technology assimilation. The findings indicate that, among the innovation characteristics, perceived complexity and perceived maturity of technology have been found to have positive relationships with organizational assimilation of OO technology. Among the organizational characteristics, intensity of new technology education was positively related to organizational assimilation of OO technology, and satisfaction with existing technology was negatively related to organizational assimilation of OO technology.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,125,156

The framework is divided into four levels: paradigms, approaches, methodologies, and techniques. This paper primarily focuses on the two intermediate levels: approaches and methodologies. The principal contribution of the framework is in providing a new kind of ""deep structure"" for better understanding the intellectual core of methodologies and approaches and their interrelationships. It achieves this goal by articulating a parsimonious set of foundational features that are shared by subsets of methodologies and approaches. To illustrate how the framework's deep structure provides a better understanding of methodologies' intellectual core, it is applied to eleven examples. The paper also introduces and illustrates a procedure for ""accommodating"" and ""assimilating"" new information systems development methodologies in addition to the eleven already discussed. This procedure provides the framework with the necessary flexibility for handling the continuing proliferation of new methodologies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,3,179,218

As personal information becomes more accessible, individuals worry that businesses misuse the information that is collected while they are online. Organizations have tried to mitigate this concern in two ways: (1) by offering privacy policies regarding the handling and use of personal information and (2) by offering benefits such as financial gains or convenience. In this paper, we interpret these actions in the context of the information-processing theory of motivation. Information-processing theories, also known as expectancy theories in the context of motivated behavior, are built on the premise that people process information about behavior--outcome relationships. By doing so, they are forming expectations and making decisions about what behavior to choose. Using an experimental setting, we empirically validate predictions that the means to mitigate privacy concerns are associated with positive valences resulting in an increase in motivational score. In a conjoint analysis exercise, 268 participants from the United States and Singapore face trade-off situations, where an organization may only offer incomplete privacy protection or some benefits. While privacy protections (against secondary use, improper access, and error) are associated with positive valences, we also find that financial gains and convenience can significantly increase individuals' motivational score of registering with a Web site. We find that benefits--monetary reward and future convenience--significantly affect individuals' preferences over Web sites with differing privacy policies. We also quantify the value of Web site privacy protection. Among U.S. subjects protection against errors, improper access, and secondary use of personal information is worth $30.49--$44.62. Finally, our approach also allows us to identify three distinct segments of Internet...",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,2,13,42

Love,The Propagation of Technology Management Taxonomies for Evaluating Investments in Information Systems, benefits;  costs;  evaluation;  investment;  MRPII;  taxonomy;  technology management,"The management of Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS) is considered a complex exercise by academics and practitioners alike. The reason for this is that there are ubiquitous portfolios of tangible and intangible benefits that are offered to an organization following the adoption of IT/IS that, in turn, all need managing to ensure realization. Organizations also have to take into account the direct and often larger indirect costs that are typically associated with IT/IS deployments. To provide managers with a critical insight into the management of new technology, this paper uses a case study research strategy to examine the technology management experiences of a leading U.K. manufacturing organization during its adoption of a vendor-supplied Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRPII) information system. Following the lack of attention given to human and organizational technology management factors while implementing MRPII, the vendor-based information system was later abandoned and deemed a failure. In addressing those technology management factors that were later identified as important, it was found that key employees were able to overcome a number of organizational barriers and develop and implement a bespoke MRPII system that significantly improved the organization's competitive position. Technology management taxonomies that contributed to the failure and later successful implementation of MRPII are identified and discussed. The organization's experiences in solving the problems associated with the implementation of their IS offers a learning opportunity for those companies that are seeking a competitive advantage through technology management.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,3,161,177

The early adoption of patient portals by ambulatory-care clinics (outpatient health providers) presents a unique opportunity to more fully understand the characteristics of supply-side adopters in a context where firms (ambulatory-care clinics) are extending digital services to consumers (patients). Using diffusion of innovations literature and contingency theory as the theoretical base, we expand upon the firm characteristics traditionally considered to be predictors of adoption (e.g., firm size, slack resources, competition, capabilities, and management support) and examine how demand contingencies, service contingencies, and learning externality contingencies affect patient portal adoption by ambulatory-care clinics in the United States. We find that early adopters often have a structure in place that provides support for innovations (e.g., part of integrated delivery systems), as would be predicted by diffusion of innovation theory. We also find, though, that service contingencies associated with continuity of care, learning externality contingencies associated with local influences, and select demand contingencies associated with the local market significantly influence patient portal adoption decisions. Our findings suggest that the adoption and diffusion of patient portals may be affected by more than traditionally considered ""dominant"" firm characteristics and provide insights into how such customer-facing systems may be affected by contingent factors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,2,293,324
722, Gretchen Irwin,The Role of Similarity in the Reuse of Object-Oriented Analysis Models, analogical reasoning;  object-oriented analysis;  software reuse;  verbal protocol,"Software reuse--the application of existing software artifacts in the development of a new system--has been claimed to dramatically improve system development productivity and quality. These claims have been particularly pronounced with respect to the reuse of object-oriented (OO) software artifacts. However, the empirical evaluations of these claims are relatively sparse and often inconsistent. This paper begins to address the gap in the literature. A verbal-protocol study was conducted in which analysts created a model for a problem (the target) and were given an example problem and solution (the source) to reuse. The results show little support for reuse in OO analysis. First, reuse had no effect on the quality of the OO analysis models. Subjects given a highly reusable example produced solutions that were no better than those of subjects in the control group. Second, the degree of similarity between the source and target problems did have an effect on the reuse process, although it did not impact the reuse outcome. Subjects given the example with the most similarity to the target problem quickly recognized the reuse potential, attempted a fair amount of reuse, but made several errors stemming from lazy copying. Subjects given an example with a lesser (but still significant) degree of similarity were often unable to recognize the reuse potential, and thus engaged in less rescue activity. Thus, the characteristics of the source-target comparison that facilitate noticing the reuse potential of the source do not necessarily help in applying the source solution to the target problem. These results suggest that the claims associated with reuse should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,2,219,248

This study establishes partnership quality as a key predictor of outsourcing success. The authors propose a theoretical framework for outsourcing partnership based on a social, rather than an economic, perspective. They identify the partnership-related variables from the relevant literature and clarify the concept of partnership quality by distinguishing between its components and its determinants. They then examine the impact of partnership quality on outsourcing success. Hypotheses on partnership quality were tested for 74 outsourcing relationships between 36 service receivers and 54 service providers. Results indicate that partnership quality may serve as a key predictor of outsourcing success. Partnership quality was found to be positively influenced by factors such as participation, communication, information sharing, and top management support, and negatively affected by age of relationship and mutual dependency.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1999,4,29,61

In this research, we bring these concepts of vendor silence and cultural adaptation in cross-cultural teams together and develop a process framework that illustrates how vendor silence may be mitigated in offshore outsourcing through various silence mitigation mechanisms. We then develop three propositions for organizational action toward mitigating vendor silence, which highlight the mediating role of cultural adaptation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,261,298

See-To;  Kar Yan Tam,The Impact of Open Source Software on the Strategic Choices of Firms Developing Proprietary Software,,"Open source software (OSS) is now posing significant competition to proprietary or closed source software (CSS) in several software markets. In this paper, we characterize the response of a firm developing CSS (where the CSS is a revenue earner) to the presence of an OSS in its market. In particular, we look at the firm's choice of resource investments to improve quality and the firm's pricing decisions. We are primarily motivated by the following questions: Would a firm producing CSS produce higher-quality software when it faces competition from an OSS than when there is no OSS in its market? Would there be a change in the firm's response if the CSS faced competition from another CSS in addition to competition from the OSS? We show that the firm produces lower-quality CSS when it faces competition from an OSS than when it does not. Also, the quality of the CSS decreases as the quality of the OSS increases. This result holds true even if we consider network effects. When we consider competition from another CSS, in addition to competition from the OSS, then the quality of the CSS could increase or decrease as the quality of the OSS increases. The change in quality depends on how closely substitutable the two CSS are. We also extend our base model to consider (1) competition for resources, (2) uncertainty in resources available to the OSS, and (3) uncertainty about the software development process.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,241,275

Firms often exercise their power and offer reciprocal investments to their trading partners in developing an IOS network. However, limited effort has been made to empirically validate their effects on increasing IOS usage between trading partners. This paper gauges the effects of these two relational factors--power and reciprocal investments--within the context of an electronic data interchange (EDI) network development. Moreover, the role of channel climate in increasing EDI usage is explicated with a particular focus on its determinants and impacts. With insights obtained from social exchange and transaction cost theories, a research model is developed and tested with data collected from 233 suppliers with electronic linkages via EDI with a nationally recognized retailer of home improvement supplies and materials in the United States. The customer's reciprocal investments in the form of BDI-related support are proven to be effective in increasing EDI volume and diversity. However, power exercised is found to be not effective. Suppliers' cooperation with the customer, which is influenced by perceived uncertainty, trust, and transaction-specific investments, is found to have strong effects on EDI volume and diversity.

Drawing on transaction cost theory and institutional theory, this paper identifies two groups of factors--efficiency- and legitimacy-oriented factors, respectively--that can influence organizational buyers' initial adoption of, and the level of participation in, B2B e-marketplaces. The effects of these factors on initial adoption of and participation level in B2B e-marketplaces are empirically tested with data collected, respectively, from 98 potential adopter and 85 current adopter organizations. The results of a partial least squares analysis of the data indicate that the two groups of factors exhibit different patterns in explaining initial adoption in the preadoption period and participation level in the postadoption period. Specifically, all three of the efficiency-oriented factors investigated in this study--product characteristics, demand uncertainty, and market volatility--and their subconstructs exhibit a significant influence on adoption intent or participation level, or both. The results demonstrate that two legitimacy-oriented factors--mimetic pressures and normative pressures--and their subconstructs have a significant impact on adoption intent, but not on participation level. Our findings also indicate that clearly different patterns exist between the two groups of factors in explaining adoption intent and participation level.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,1,55,99

Information systems departments have not been insulated from these trends. In spite of the rising interest in these initiatives, little is known about their impact on the systems development process. Past research in blue-collar contexts suggests that teams produce improvements in performance, while anecdotal evidence in the IS industry suggests that such improvements may never materialize. This paper reports on research conducted with 231 IS professionals from 27 systems development teams across 13 organizations. The results indicate that, while autonomy may lead to increased levels of satisfaction and motivation, the level of team development and an organization's learning capacity may be more important in achieving improved work outcomes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,1,41,68

Based on the concepts of IT acquisition and utilization, an assimilation framework is presented to highlight four states (limited, focused, lagging, and pervasive) that capture the assimilation of conferencing and groupware CITs. Data collected from 538 organizations in the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Norway, and Switzerland are aggregated and analyzed to explore assimilation patterns and the influence of decision-making pattern, functional integration, promotion of collaboration, organization size, and IT function size on the assimilation of CITs. Although most of these factors influence assimilation of CITs from nonadoption to a state of limited assimilation, and from limited assimilation to a state of pervasive assimilation, they may not be critical when assimilation of CITs deviates from the expected path. The implications of our findings are discussed for practice and research on assimilation of CITs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,131,165

Domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated into a specialized database architecture that leaves the designer only with the task of specifying the application-specific parts. Based on an analysis of business constraints, we propose such an architecture for the domain of business transaction processing. The architecture offers several data and transaction management services, special-purpose subdatabases, and design-checking rules to be used by the application designer. Two services, input management and audit and control services, are described in more detail.",Journal of Management Information Systems,1,1984,1,63,80

The constraints of these crude information processing technologies often required workers to be located under one roof and organizations to arrange themselves as efficient, but relatively change-resistant, management hierarchies. Those legacy organization designs have persisted despite fundamental changes in information processing technology. Tomorrow's successful organizations will be designed around the building blocks of advanced computer and communications technology. The success of these organizations will come from the ability to couple to, and decouple from, the networks of knowledge nodes. These networked organizations will link, on an as-needed basis, teams of empowered employees, consultants, suppliers, and customers. These ad hoc teams will solve one-time problems, provide personalized customer service, and then, as lubricant for subsequent interactions, evaluate one another's performance. In the network organization, structure will dominate strategy, credentials will give way to performance and knowledge, and human resources will be the only sustainable advantage. Despite the promise, networked organizations present difficult information management challenges. Among these are developing a flexible and efficient information architecture, establishing new values, attitudes, and behaviors concerning information sharing, building databases that can provide integrated customer support on a worldwide basis, and protecting personal freedoms and privacy. Here, we explore the opportunities and challenges that networked organizations will present for information technology management.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1994,4,25,57

In such teams, coordination is accomplished via trust and shared communication systems. The focus of the reported study was to explore the antecedents of trust in a global virtual-team setting. Seventy-five teams, consisting of four to six members residing in different countries, interacted and worked together for eight weeks. The two-week trust-building exercises did have a significant effect on the team members' perceptions of the other members' ability, integrity, and benevolence. In the early phases of teamwork, team trust was predicted strongest by perceptions of other team members' integrity, and weakest by perceptions of their benevolence. The effect of other members' perceived ability on trust decreased over time. The members' own propensity to trust had a significant, though unchanging, effect on trust. A qualitative analysis of six teams' electronic mail messages explored strategies that were used by the three highest trust teams, but were used infrequently or not at all by the three lowest trust teams. The strategies suggest the presence of ""swift"" trust. The paper advances a research model for explaining trust in global virtual teams.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1998,4,29,64

Beliefs about property rights affect information and knowledge sharing. This study explored factors that help determine an individual's beliefs about the organizational ownership of information and expertise that he or she has created. Four different situations of organizational ownership (information vs. expertise/internal vs. external sharing) were considered. The study found that a belief in self-owner-ship was positively associated with organizational ownership-suggesting a collaborative type of ownership situation for both information and expertise and for both internal (intraorganizational) and external (interorganizational) sharing situations. Organizational culture and the type of employee also influenced the beliefs of organizational ownership in all four scenarios.

With the credibility of online reviewers a frequent question, this research investigates how potential buyers assess the credibility of anonymous reviewers. Technology separates the reviewer from the review, and potential buyers are left to rely on characteristics of the review itself to determine the credibility of the reviewer. By extending the language expectancy theory to the online setting, we develop hypotheses about how expectancy violations of lexical complexity, two-sidedness (highlighting positive and negative aspects of a product), and affect intensity influence credibility attributions. We present an experiment in which favorable experimental reviews were generated based on actual reviews for a digital camera. The results indicate that two-sidedness caused a positive expectancy violation resulting in greater credibility attribution. High affect intensity caused a negative expectancy violation resulting in lower credibility attribution. Finally, high reviewer credibility significantly improved perceptions of product quality. Our results demonstrate the importance of expectancies and violations when attributing credibility to anonymous individuals. Even small expectancy violations can meaningfully influence reviewer credibility and perceptions of products.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,293,324

Recent research offers unobtrusive credibility assessment aids as a solution; however, the accuracy of these decision aids is inadequate, and users often resist accepting the aids' recommendations. We follow the principles of signal detection theory to improve the accuracy of recommendations in computer-aided credibility assessment by combining automated and participatory decision support. We also leverage participation in decision-making theory to explain and predict an increased acceptance of assessment aid recommendations when perceptual cues are elicited from users. Based on these two theories, we design and test a hybrid decision aid to perform automated linguistic analysis and to elicit and analyze perceptual cues from an observer. Results from a laboratory experiment indicate that decision aids that use linguistic and perceptual cues offer more accurate recommendations than aids that use only one type of cue. Automatic analysis of linguistic cues improved both the decision aid's recommendations and the users' credibility assessment accuracy. Challenging the generalizability of past findings, the elicitation of perceptual cues did not improve the decision aid's recommendations or the users' assessment accuracy. Elicitation of perceptual cues, however, did improve user acceptance of the decision aid's recommendations. These findings provide guidance for future development of credibility assessment decision aids.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,201,233

The inability of an organization to match career desires is often related to measures indicative of turnover in IS employees, including intent to leave and career dissatisfaction, though empirical evidence is indirect and inconclusive. Using career orientations, this study explicitly models the impact of the discrepancy between the wants of employees and employee perceptions of how their organization satisfies those wants. The model is based on discrepancy theory and predicts the gap is closely related to the turnover indicators. Model predictions hold true for a sample of 153 IS personnel.

While the benefits resulting from network externality have been examined in the related literature, the effect of free offer on the diffusion of new software has not been formally analyzed. We show in this study that even if other benefits do not exist, a software firm can still benefit from giving away fully functioning software. This is due to the accelerated diffusion process and subsequently the increased net present value of future sales. By adapting the Bass diffusion model to capture the impact of free software offer, we provide a methodology to determine the optimal number of free adopters. We show that the optimal free offer solution depends on the discount rate, the length of the demand window, and the ratio of low-valuation to high-valuation free adopters. Our methodology is shown to be applicable for both fixed and dynamic pricing strategies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,207,239

In this paper, we argue that different research methods and activities may interact with each other, different research paradigms may complement each other due to such interactions, and therefore, a multimethodological, cross-paradigm research approach may result in better IS research than a singular approach. Three existing multimethodological IS research frameworks are reviewed and summarized into an integrated approach. Two types of interactions between different research methods across system evaluation and theory testing research activities are identified.

The purpose of the study was to identify the extent to which CIM technologies are in use in U.S. firms, the impact of a facility's process characteristics on the CIM development process, and the adoption policy being followed implicitly or explicitly. The survey focused on manufacturing process characteristics, the CIM development process, the CIM architecture, and perceived value and benefits. Our results indicate that CIM implementations follow a definite temporal pattern with respect to the adoption of certain information technologies. We also find evidence of labor substitution through CIM, although the direct labor jobs that are lost are partially replaced by engineering and design tasks. While most CIM users find that their CIM projects successfully meet their initial operational goals, the technology seems to be poorly integrated in most sites. More crucially, it appears that CIM does not live up to its promise: it is not being adopted as a strategic information system for competitive missions. The initiative for CIM programs is usually generated from the bottom-up by small groups of technical experts who tend to focus on localized data-processing concerns. This gradual bottom-up approach appears to severely restrain, rather than enable, plant-wide integration for critical crossfunctional business processes such as order fulfillment or the introduction of new products. The decentralized, bottom-up, development pattern of these information systems reinforces the existence of many incompatible divisional islands of automation, thereby negatively affecting the competitive capability of the firm.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,2,59,82

Communication theory predicts that greater communication frequency and channel richness lead to more such convergence. A postal survey of 202 pairs of CEOs and CIOs investigated the effect of communication frequency and channel richness on CEO/ CIO convergence, as well as the effect of convergence on the financial contribution of information systems (IS) to the organization. Convergence was operationalized in terms of the current and future roles of information technology (IT) as defined by the strategic grid. Rigorous validation confirmed the current role as composed of one factor and the future role as composed of three factors (i.e., managerial support, differentiation, and enhancement). More frequent communication predicted convergence about the current role, differentiation future role, and enhancement future role. The use of richer channels predicted convergence about the differentiation future role. Convergence about the current role predicted IS financial contribution. From a research perspective, the study extended theory about communication frequency, media richness, convergence, and the role of IT in organizations.

We also characterize the threat of loss by examining search patterns in peer-to-peer networks. Our analysis demonstrates both a substantial threat and vulnerability for large financial firms.

For example, instead of playing off dozens or even hundreds of competing suppliers against one another, many firms are finding it more profitable to work closely with only a small number of ""partners."" In this paper we explore some causes and consequences of this transformation. We apply the economic theory of incomplete contracts to determine the optimal strategy for a buyer. We find that the buyer firm will often maximize profits by limiting its options and reducing its own bargaining power. This may seem paradoxical in an age of cheap communications costs and aggressive competition. However, unlike earlier models that focused on coordination costs, we focus on the critical importance of providing incentives for suppliers. Our results spring from the need to make it worthwhile for suppliers to invest in ""noncontractibles"" such as innovation, responsiveness, and information sharing. Such incentives will often be stronger when the number of competing suppliers is small. The findings of the theoretical models appear to be consistent with observations from empirical research which highlight the key role of information technology in enabling this transformation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,2,37,53

The studies did not consider the evolution level of IS in examining influence factors of IS performance. They have tried to identify critical influence factors without considering the state of the IS and the IS department, that is, the levels of IS evolution. The objectives of this study are to examine the direct relationships between influence factors and performance of accounting information systems (AIS), and to identify the moderating effect of evolution level of IS on the relationships. In this study, the direct relationships and the moderating effect of evolution level of IS were hypothesized. The results of the empirical test suggested that there are significant positive correlations between the performance of an AIS and the influence factors such as user involvement, capability of IS personnel and organization size. It was also proved that the relationships between performance of AIS and influence factors are significantly influenced by the evolution level of IS. Hence, for the success of AIS, each influence factor should be considered differently in the degree of importance according to the level of IS evolution.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1996,4,215,239

Numerous decision support applications have been modeled as graph matching, set covering, and partitioning problems. These include applications in the areas of task assignment, marriage problem, airline crew scheduling, truck deliveries or vehicle routing, political redistricting, and the like. Currently, these applications are supported through programs written in external (to the database system) programming languages that use only the data in the database system. Thus, decision makers or application programmers require extra effort to get required decision support information. As opposed to database systems, the purpose of a model management system (MMS) is to make a wide variety of models available to decision makers so they can apply these models without having to become involved in technical and/or procedural aspects of implementation. The goal of this research is to integrate database systems and model systems for zero-one integer programming problems especially concerning graph matching, set covering, and partitioning problems. Users utilize a single integrated language for both problem formulation and model execution. In order to achieve this goal, we extend relational operators and the query language SQL. The relational operators are extended with six operators, namely, match, maxmatch, cover, mincover, partition, and minpartition. Some of these operators may take a very long time to find an optimal solution. In this article, we adopted genetic algorithms to find a near-optimal solution of this kind of operators. We found they performed well both on the computational effort and on the quality of the solutions through a variety of test problems. These algorithms are bounded by a polynomial time. Therefore, they enable a DBMS to respond to queries involving proposed operators in a restricted amount of time.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,1,101,129

Consequently, understanding and predicting employee quitting or separation behavior is crucial. We incorporate human capital theory from economics to form an alternative theoretical perspective for understanding IS professionals' separation and retention. This shift allows us to focus on precursors to observed separation, rather than attitudinal precursors of intentions. We introduce three new constructs: pressure to separate, retention frontiers, and separation thresholds. These constructs provide a basis for identifying when an employee is close to leaving the firm and for a new approach to analyze the potential effectiveness of action taken by a firm to change separation behavior: pre-implementation retention intervention assessment (PRI-assessment). We illustrate the application of the new approach using data on the observed separation behavior of 661 IS professionals at a large multidivision firm.

Various ISD outcomes are addressed using a classification scheme involving two broad categories--attitudinal/behavioral outcomes and productivity outcomes. The results demonstrate that user participation is minimally-to-moderately beneficial to ISD; its effects are comparatively stronger on attitudinal/behavioral outcomes than on productivity outcomes. This attitudinal/behavioral impact may largely be the result of the emphasis that has been placed on user participation by academics and consultants. The results of this analysis are compared to those of a meta-analysis in the broader management context of participation. The results are similar in terms of attitudinal outcomes, but different, and lesser, in terms of productivity outcomes. Since the current status of research in the broad area of participation is that the effects of participation are considered to be problematic, that status and the results of this study suggest that user participation alone may not be sufficient to achieve significantly improved ISD outcomes, and that different strategies should be employed based on the specific goals of ISD projects. If system acceptance is the ultimate goal, user participation should be designed to induce more psychological involvement among potential users. If productivity benefits are the focus, user participation should be designed to provide developers the needed domain knowledge. In sum, user participation should be treated as one of a number of means for ISD projects to be more successful.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,301,331

Software project teams must be able to utilize the expertise and knowledge of participants without overwhelming individual members. To efficiently leverage individuals' knowledge and expertise, software project teams develop team cognition structures that facilitate their knowledge activities. This study focuses on the emergence and evolution of team cognition in software project teams, and examines how communication activity and team diversity impact the formation of these structures. A longitudinal study was conducted of 51 database development teams. The results suggest that some forms of communication and team diversity affect the formation of team cognition. Frequency of meetings and phone calls were positively related to the formation of team cognition, while e-mail use had no effect. Gender diversity had a strong and positive effect on the development of team cognition and the effect remained stable over time. Implications for the practical potential and limitations of purposive team construction as a strategy for improving software development team performance are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,2,261,292

Cooper,The Effect of Computer-Mediated Communication on Agreement and Acceptance, acceptance;  agreement;  computer-mediated communication systems;  electronic meeting systems technology adoption;  group decision support systems;  group performance;  group processes;  negotiation tasks,"This study develops and tests a model of relationships among computer-mediated communication systems (CMCS), group processes, and group outcomes. The group outcomes examined are agreement and acceptance. Agreement is the extent to which members of a problem-solving group hold similar views and solutions about the problem at the end of their task. Acceptance is the extent to which members of a problem-solving group acquiesce to the views and solutions of other members, while holding reservations about those views and solutions. The distinction between agreement and acceptance is important because members in agreement are more likely to support the implementation of their solution than are those who merely accept the solution. Based on a laboratory experiment, the authors find that socioemotional communication (both positive--showing friendliness and supportiveness--and negative---showing hostility and rejection) as well as task-oriented communication play important mediating roles between CMCS use and acceptance and agreement. The findings suggest ways to promote agreement through management intervention and CMCS design. In addition, their findings suggest some intriguing avenues for further research, such as the lack of symmetry between the effects of positive and negative socioemotional communication.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,1,165,188

The effects on decision quality of two important communication system factors, cue multiplicity and feedback immediacy, are examined in light of three important mediating constructs: social perceptions, message clarity, and ability to evaluate others. A laboratory experiment examining two tasks and employing face-to-face, electronic meeting, electronic conferencing, and electronic mail communication systems is used to assess the model's validity. Results provide consistent support for the research model as well as media richness theory. Richer media facilitate social perceptions (total socio-emotional communication and positive socio-emotional climate) and perceived ability to evaluate others' deception and expertise. Leaner media (electronic mail and electronic conferencing) facilitate communication clarity when participants have less task-relevant knowledge. The impacts of these mediating constructs on decision quality were found to depend on the levels of participant expertise and deception. In general, it was found that richer media can have significantly positive impacts on decision quality when participants' task-relevant knowledge is high. Moreover, effects of participant deception can be mitigated by employing richer media. ",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,1,263,299

These other models have proven to be neither consistent nor concise. Additionally, they have lacked consensus on the number of stages and on their constituent activities. To develop a new model, a field study was conducted. Interviews and a questionnaire were used to identify tasks which were important to the DBA in the performance of the function.

Many researchers have started to investigate the optimal competitive strategies and market environments for such products. This paper studies the competitive decisions made about software, a major class of digital products that can be easily sold through computer networks. Instead of focusing on traditional competitive dimensions, such as price or quantity, we study the number of functions that should be incorporated into the software. Using game theoretic analysis, we show that there is no fixed strategy that is optimal for software developers in a duopoly market with one-stage simultaneous moves. This happens because, given one developer's decision, there is always an incentive for the other developer to deviate and achieve higher payoffs. Nevertheless, a unique reactive equilibrium does emerge if we consider the two-stage variation of the model, where the two developers both enjoy substantial profits by serving different segments of the market. Essentially, the first mover commits himself to a certain functionality level that induces a rational follower to target his software to the (previously) unattended segment. We discuss our results in light of scale economies in the software development process and market segmentation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,1,151,184

During the development phase, part of the work-domain-related knowledge is formalized and encoded in the software, making it difficult for users to reflect on and use this knowledge. This design/use dualism contributes to the deterioration of the interpretive flexibility of information systems. The authors propose an information systems architecture called Dual Information Systems (DIS) that helps bridge the design/use dualism by providing organizations with a set of services that enable and reinforce both effective, institutionalized working and the questioning and (re)construction of computer-supported work routines. DIS have a four-layered conceptual structure: (1) people draw on the business layer to work and learn; (2) people use the breakdown layer to handle unexpected breakdowns; (3) self-organizing project teams use the project layer to create innovative work and IS (re)designs; and (4) the knowledge-sharing server stores these redesigns and makes them organizationally available to facilitate working and learning as well as subsequent redesign efforts. In this paper, the authors first outline the theoretical background, conceptual design, and generic services of DIS. Next, they elaborate on the work-process benchmarking service of DIS, which supports project teams in analyzing and redesigning computer-supported work through lateral sharing of knowledge of work processes between business units. Finally, they demonstrate the benchmarking service with the help of the ReDIS prototype.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,1,87,119

This paper develops a model that characterizes the intermediary's pricing in two-sided networks, the value created by these networks, and the allocation of that value across the two sides. It extends the two-sided networks literature by endogenizing the level of network effects as the result of relevant investments by the intermediary, which determine the design of the network. It shows that under certain assumptions about the available technologies, the design of the two-sided network is highly asymmetric independent of its ownership structure. The paper provides insight into design strategies for Internet platforms, and it discusses their welfare implications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,2,171,202

Indeed, electronic integration strategies alter the fundamental structure of both firms as well as their environments, requiring a shift in the study of organizations from the level of a focal firm to that of the business network. The business network represents the pattern of interdependent relationships between the activities of a given firm and those of other firms in its competitive environment that influence each other's strategies. We analyze here the effects of electronic integration on organization structure and competitive processes at the level of the business network. We propose the roles-linkage perspective as a useful abstraction to characterize the business network and guide research on the effects of information technology on industry structures. Building and analyzing the effects of electronic filing on the tax preparation market, we build a preliminary model of how electronic integration strategies alter roles and linkages in a business network.

We utilize findings from the vast amount of training research conducted thus far and point to some problems that might occur when existing strategies are applied to train users of collaborative applications. We test our ideas by conducting a longitudinal field study of a collaborative work flow application. As proposed in a recent knowledge-level framework, our findings indicate that training programs must not solely focus on developing users' system proficiency skills but must also educate users about the business processes that the collaborative application will support. This additional knowledge will enable users to deal with technology-induced changes in the business processes due to the deployment of the collaborative application. Furthermore, we find that training programs should sensitize users to the interdependencies that exist among their tasks and make them aware of the collective consequences of their individual actions. We also found that users have to engage in collective problem solving efforts and continuously learn new knowledge during the process of appropriation of the collaborative application. We propose a training framework that integrates these ideas to prepare users to make effective use of collaborative applications. The proposed framework calls for trainers to be continuously engaged with users and help refine their knowledge during the process of appropriation. We suggest that theoretical foundations rooted in collective learning be adopted to guide training research in collaborative applications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,3,257,281

There is much potential for conflict in GVTs as members work across cultural, geographical, and time boundaries. This study examines the antecedents of GVT conflict and the circumstances under which conflict affects team performance. An in-depth study of GVT conflict episodes was carried out using interviews, observations, communication logs, and documents. Based on findings from the teams under study interpreted in the light of prior literature, propositions are developed about the antecedents and effects of GVT conflict as stated. Within GVTs, cultural diversity is likely to contribute to both task and relationship conflict while functional diversity may result in task conflict. Large volumes of electronic communication and lack of immediacy of feedback in asynchronous media can contribute to task conflict. Moreover, the relationship between task conflict and team performance is likely to be contingent upon task complexity and conflict resolution approach. The influence of relationship conflict on performance may depend on task interdependence and conflict resolution approach. The conflict resolution approach may in turn be determined by the nature of conflict attribution. These propositions have been synthesized into a model to guide future empirical research and GVT practice.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,3,237,274
771, Tam Kar Yan,Dynamic Price Elasticity and the Diffusion of Mainframe Computing, innovation diffusion;  information technology adoption;  price elasticity,"The organizational adoption of information technology (IT) innovations has been an area of increasing research activity in the last two decades. While much attention has focused on the relationship between attributes of the innovation and the adoption decision, little has been done to study the adopters' reactions to changes in these attributes over time. An important innovation attribute is price, which is commonly used as a proxy for adoption cost. In this paper, we investigate how organizations in the United States react to mainframe price changes over a period of thirty years, from 1955 to 1984. A parsimonious diffusion model that integrates both diffusion and pricing effects is developed. The model is empirically tested using annual adoption and pricing data of mainframes. Quality-adjusted price index is used to account for any changes in quality improvement overtime. Our findings indicate that (1) price is an important factor in the diffusion process, (2) organizations' reactions to price changes (i.e., price elasticity) are not constant, and (3) elasticity dynamics can serve as an innovation attribute that provides a continuous characterization of adoption behavior over the life cycle of an innovation. Implications to IS research and opportunities for future work are also discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,2,163,183

Our intent is to empirically assess the effects of product variety, brand name, average price, and network externalities in the selection of computer vendors. To ensure that the effects are not technology-dependent, we deliberately use long time series data to calibrate the model. Annual data at the vendor level from 1965 to 1993 is used to infer the choice criteria of IT managers in three computer categories: mainframe, minis, and small systems. Our empirical findings indicate that a broader product line and a strong brand can effectively enhance the choice probability of a vendor.

Specifically, we theorize how the three dimensions of social capital-structural, cognitive, and relational social capital-facilitate knowledge exchange and combination between the CIO and TMT resulting in the alignment between the organization's information systems (IS) strategy and business strategy. Results show that IS alignment significantly influences the firm's financial performance and mediates the relationship between CIO-TMT social capital and performance. The findings also indicate that cognitive and relational social capital influence information systems strategic alignment but that structural social capital exerts its influence through its effects on cognitive social capital. Recommendations are provided as to how organizations can develop CIO-TMT structural, cognitive, and relational social capital to positively influence firm performance via IS strategic alignment.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,15,56

This is by now standard in on-line analytical processing (OLAP) applications, and the authors reaffirm it with additional reasons. Second, and innovatively, they use prediction analysis as a measure of goodness for hypotheses. Prediction analysis is an established statistical technique for analysis of associations among qualitative variables. It generalizes and subsumes a large number of other such measures of association, depending on specific assumptions the user is willing to make.

An experiment was conducted comparing teams of subjects with three commercially available machine learning algorithms: recursive partitioning, ID3, and a back-propagation neural network. Also, the statistical technique discriminant analysis was compared. The subjects were allowed to induce rules from historical data under ideal human conditions, such as adequate time and opportunity to sort the data as desired. The results on multiple holdout samples indicate that human judgment, recursive partitioning, and the ID3 algorithm were equally accurate and more accurate than a back-propagation neural network. Subjects who chose mixed strategies of judgment were more accurate than those using noncompensatory strategies, while no subjects chose compensatory strategies. Large decision trees were not more accurate than smaller ones. There appeared to be a time threshold for humans to form accurate decision rules. Holdout sample accuracy tended to increase with primary sample accuracy. ID3 built larger trees than did either humans or recursive partitioning. The conclusion of this research is that the knowledge engineer faced with available historical data concerning a classification problem should not waste his time discerning rules, since he will only take longer and be no more accurate than a good learning tool. Knowledge of these tools will be the requisite skill for the knowledge engineer of the 1990s.

These mechanisms are used in online auctions (e.g., eBay.com, uBid.com) and name-your-own-price (Priceline.com) formats, for example. The current research studies the dynamics of one instance of dynamic pricing--group-buying discounts--used by MobShop.com, whose products' selling prices drop as more buyers place their orders. We collect and analyze changes in the number of orders for MobShop-listed products over various periods of time, using an econometric model that reflects our understanding of bidder behavior in the presence of dynamic pricing and different levels of bidder participation. We find that the number of existing orders has a significant positive effect on new orders placed during each three-hour period, indicating the presence of a positive participation externality effect. We also find evidence for expectations of falling prices, a price drop effect. This occurs when the number of orders approaches the next price drop level and the price level for transacting will fall in the near future. The results also reveal a significant ending effect, as more orders were placed during the last three-hour period of the auction cycles.

We focus on the information technology adoption behavior of firms in the presence of transaction costs, agency costs and information uncertainty. We conclude that it is appropriate to rethink the prior theory and develop an extended transaction-cost theory perspective that incorporates the possibility of shocks. We distinguish among three kinds of B2B e-procurement systems platforms. Proprietary platform procurement systems involve traditional electronic data interchange (EDI) technologies. Open platform procurement systems are associated with e-market Web technologies. Hybrid platforms involve elements of both. We specify an analytical model that captures the key elements of our perspective, including the conditions under which strong conclusions can be made about the likely observed equilibrium e-procurement solutions of the firms. Our results explain the coexistence of both proprietary and open platforms, showing that larger firms tend to adopt costlier procurement technology solutions, such as proprietary EDI, which provides greater supply certainty. Smaller firms adopt less costly procurement technologies that entail greater supply uncertainties, such as open platform procurement systems. Two guidelines emerge for practitioners: (1) adoption of standard e-procurement platforms needs to be understood in terms of the controllable risk tradeoffs that are offered to small and large firms, and (2) gauging the business value impacts of exogenous shocks is critical to decision-making.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,137,166

This exposure may lead to cost overruns or legal responsibility for service-level breeches. Providers can leverage information about their risk positions implied by their IT services contract portfolios to gain strategic advantage over their competitors. We build theory in support of a new construct, profit-at-risk, for evaluating the trade-offs between contract profitability and service-level risk, stemming from financial economics theory and models. We simulate an IT services contract portfolio, and show how managers can reduce organizational risk by forgoing profit-maximizing contracts in lieu of more conservative service-level agreements, yet still achieve high returns. Our approach provides decision support for ex ante contract evaluation and negotiation, and a means to conduct ex post efficiency evaluation. It also aligns IT service management with best practices in financial management.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,17,48

Recent IT advances combined with certain firm and industry characteristics are prompting firms to move toward a unified procurement strategy for enterprise software solutions. Unified procurement occurs when a firm elects to purchase all compatible products and services from a single vendor. Key benefits of unified procurement involve motivating managers to alter their procurement strategy. At the top of the list of benefits is transferred risk, which includes risks that can be transferred from one participating party to another during a transaction. In the case of unified procurement, they include technology risks and integration costs that are transferred from the procurement firm to its vendor. Firms have been shifting toward a unified procurement strategy for enterprise software solutions. We discuss the evolution of procurement practices in an industry that exemplifies a manifestation of Clemons et al.'s [10] ""move to the middle"" hypothesis predictions. The adoption of unified procurement is being driven by changes in IT, firm, and industry structure. We explore the ""move to the middle,"" transaction cost economics, and industry clockspeed theory to explain this phenomenon. We present a series of propositions that extend the prior theory to the more specific setting of enterprise software procurement--an example of middle range theory development--and use mini-cases to validate the various perspectives that we offer.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,177,204

To accomplish this, we assembled thirteen culturally diverse global teams from locations in Europe, Mexico, and the United States, assigning each team a project leader and task to complete. The findings suggest that effective team leaders demonstrate the capability to deal with paradox and contradiction by performing multiple leadership roles simultaneously (behavioral complexity). Specifically, we discovered that highly effective virtual team leaders act in a mentoring role and exhibit a high degree of understanding (empathy) toward other team members. At the same time, effective leaders are also able to assert their authority without being perceived as overbearing or inflexible. Finally, effective leaders are found to be extremely effective at providing regular, detailed, and prompt communication with their peers and in articulating role relationships (responsibilities) among the virtual team members. This study provides useful insights for managers interested in developing global virtual teams, as well as for academics interested in pursuing virtual team research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,7,40

Anchoring on self-determination theory, this research investigates the antecedents and consequences of users' intrinsic motivation to explore ES features. We propose two organizational levers (i.e., autonomous job design and socialization tactics) that the management could exercise to trigger intrinsic motivation, thereby leading to improved ES feature exploration. Intrinsic motivation is manifested by hedonic motivation and normative motivation, whereas ES feature exploration is conceptualized as a dual-dimensional outcome reflected by cognitive behavior (exploratory usage) and positive affect (exploration satisfaction). Through a two-stage survey of 127 organizational users in China, we find general support for our research model. We further observe significant moderating effects of prevention focus on the association between organizational levers and intrinsic motivations. Beyond demonstrating how organizational users respond to different organizational levers, this research examines a broader, enduring challenge, which is to determine how organizational users can be induced to be intrinsically inspired to innovatively harness implemented information systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,257,290

Prior research has argued that business--IT strategic alignment facilitates business effect of IT and that contextual factors affect business--IT alignment. However, the role of knowledge considerations in the relationship between contextual factors and alignment, and the role of IT projects in the relationship between alignment and business effects of IT, have not been explicitly examined. Therefore, this paper pursues the following two research questions: (1) Based on knowledge considerations, how do planning behaviors (specifically, IT managers' participation in business planning and business managers' participation in IT planning) and top management knowledge of IT mediate the effects of two contextual factors--organizational emphasis on knowledge management and centralization of IT decisions--on business--IT strategic alignment? (2) How do aspects of IT projects (specifically, quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projects) mediate the relationship between business--IT strategic alignment and business effects of IT? Results from a survey of 274 senior information officers indicate that organizational emphasis on knowledge management and centralization of IT decisions affect top managers' knowledge of IT, which facilitates business managers' participation in strategic IT planning and IT managers' participation in business planning, and both of these planning behaviors affect business--IT strategic alignment. Moreover, the results indicate that quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projects mediate the relationship between business--IT strategic alignment and business effect of IT. These findings highlight the importance of considering the planning and implementation of IT projects when examining the effects of business--IT strategic alignment, and highlight the importance of considering...",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,3,129,162

Unlike in traditional auctions, these sellers are content to sell as soon as some target price is reached. While a wealth of literature exists on the final rent of the various stakeholders in a traditional auction setting, what is of interest here is to estimate the time required to reach a certain bid level in ongoing auctions. This paper introduces an analytical model to estimate the time it takes an online auction to reach a prespecified price threshold. The motivation for the research is to avoid unnecessary delays in conducting the transaction. Specifying the right duration would benefit small sellers who would realize the revenue proceeds from the sale faster. To this end, we model the bidding process as an infinite quasi-birth-death process, characterized by bursts of rapid bidding and subsequent lulls. We obtain closed-form solutions for the transient probability distribution in the frequency domain of the bid prices in an ongoing auction, which are then used to compute the transient probability distributions in the time domain. Experienced auctioneers can use these results to estimate expected ending times for their auctions. Sample observations from online auctions indicate that there may be potential room for improvement for sellers in setting their auction ending times. Simulations of the quasi-birth-death processes back up the theoretical observations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,275,301

One pattern of failure that has been observed but seldom studied is the runaway project that takes on a life of its own. Such projects exhibit characteristics that are consistent with the broader phenomenon known as escalating commitment to a failing course of action. Several theories have been offered to explain this phenomenon, including self-justification theory and the so-called sunk cost effect which can be explained by prospect theory. This paper discusses the results of a series of experiments designed to test whether the phenomenon of escalating commitment could be observed in an IT context. Multiple experiments conducted within and across cultures suggest that a high level of sunk cost may influence decision makers to escalate their commitment to an IT project. In addition to discussing this and other findings from an ongoing stream of research, the paper focuses on the challenges faced in carrying out the experiments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,3,65,85

In many cases, whether a troubled project ultimately succeeds or fails depends on the effectiveness of managerial actions taken to turn around or redirect such projects. Before such actions can be taken, however, management must recognize problems and prepare to take appropriate corrective measures. While prior research has identified many factors that contribute to the escalation of commitment to failing courses of action, there has been little research on the factors contributing to the deescalation of commitment. Through deescalation, troubled projects may be successfully turned around or sensibly abandoned. This study seeks to clarify the factors that contribute to software project deescalation and to establish practical guidelines for identifying and managing troubled projects. Through interviews with forty-two IS auditors, the authors gathered both quantitative and qualitative data about the deescalation of commitment to troubled software projects. The interviews sought judgments about the importance of twelve specific factors derived from a review of the literature on deescalation. Interviews also generated qualitative data about specific actors and actions taken to turn troubled projects around. The results indicate that the escalation and deescalation phases of projects manifest different portraits. While there were no factors that always turned projects around, many actors triggered deescalation, and many specific actions accounted for deescalation. In the majority of cases, deescalation was triggered by actors such as senior managers, internal auditors, or external consultants. Deescalation was achieved both by managing existing resources better and by changing the level of resources committed to the project. We summarize the implications of these findings in a process model of project deescalation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1999,4,63,87

We leverage a design science approach to implement a novel hybrid methodology based on concepts from the service-oriented paradigm. We motivate the approach using theory on interdependence and coordination, and design the methodology using theory on modularity and service-dominant logic. We also examine the effects of its adoption at a large electrical power company over a three-year period.

Much of this research has focused on pricing policies, protection against piracy, and governmental policies in the software industry. In this research, we focus on pricing policies of producers of digital experience goods. We consider a heterogeneous consumer market with different segments, each having a different affinity to piracy. We analyze the effect of different producer pricing policies on the revenue of the creator of the product, who may be different than the producer. Our results indicate that the explicit incorporation of these different consumer segments will cause the producer to charge lower prices and, therefore, lead to higher legal product diffusion. We show that the royalty system does not solve the double marginalization problem and is suboptimal from a supply-chain perspective. Also, the creator of the goods prefers a lower price than the producer's optimal price, and this tendency increases with the creator's per unit royalty.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,109,141

Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and Toulmin's model of argumentation, we examine the effects on consumer trust of two levels of source and two levels of content factors, under two levels of product price, in a laboratory experiment with 128 subjects. Product price was predicted as a moderating factor that would influence the customer's motivation to scrutinize more closely the content of the trust-assuring arguments. The results suggest that customers are more influenced by the content of trust-assuring arguments when the price of a product is relatively high than when it is relatively low. Presumably, Internet stores employ a third party's trust-assuring arguments because customers are less likely to trust an unknown Internet store's own trust-assuring arguments. However, the results paradoxically may imply that when customers have more at stake (e.g., buying a high-price product), they do not necessarily have to rely only on an independent third-party source to form high trust beliefs about the store. When customers purchase a high-price product, they seem to form trusting beliefs by scrutinizing argument content rather than by depending on heuristic cues (e.g., an independent party's opinion) as the ELM would predict.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,175,206

Adopting trust-building foundations from cross-culture literature and focusing on a set of well-established cultural constructs as groups of culture (Type I and Type II), this study develops a theoretical model of self-perception-based versus transference-based consumer trust in e-vendors, and empirically tests the model using cross-cultural data. The results show that transference-based trust determinants (i.e., ""perceived importance of third-party seal"" and ""perceived importance of positive referral"") are more positively related to consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type II (i.e., collectivist--strong uncertainty avoidance--high long-term orientation--high context) culture than in a Type I (i.e., individualistic--weak uncertainty avoidance--low long-term orientation--low context) culture. Unlike the initial hypothesized expectations, self-perception-based trust determinants (i.e., perceived security protection, perceived privacy concern, and perceived system reliability) do not show stronger roles to consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a Type II culture, although the stronger negative effect of perceived privacy concerns is observed on consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a Type II culture.

While relevant studies presume that humans and materials are distinct and largely independent, sociomateriality emphasizes agency that represents the relational, emergent, and shifting capacity realized through the association of actors (both humans and materials). The objective of this paper is to explore the value of conducting IT capability research through the theoretical lens of sociomaterialism. For this, we expand the imbrication metaphor introduced in an early study to explain the formation and advancement of a firm's IT capability from the sociomaterial perspective. Then, the key building blocks of IT capability of an organization are conceptualized based on the combination of existing studies and the expanded imbrication metaphor. Lastly, the effectiveness of formulating IT capability as a third-order construct that substantiates the entanglement concept of sociomaterialism is examined in comparison with that of traditional modeling approaches. We confirm the value of sociomaterialism in conceptualizing IT capability and subsequently in unraveling the true contribution of IT capability toward strengthening business performance. The findings also have practical implications in which IT capability is a function of IT management capability as well as IT personnel capability and IT infrastructure capability.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,327,362

Based on this framework, we generate a set of predictions on the differential effects of mobile channel introduction across different product categories. We test the predictions by applying a counterfactual analysis based on vector autoregression to a large panel data set from a leading e-market in Korea that covers a 28-month period and contains all of the transactions made through the online and mobile channels before and after the mobile channel introduction. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, our results suggest that the performance impact of the mobile channel depends on the two product characteristics and the resulting product-channel fit.

It begins by considering information flows in the workplace as a source of potential gains in efficiency. We next investigate work-flow automation and electronic data interchange (EDI) as indicative of current technologies applied to work processes and message management. Having described current technology and our vision of work processes, we propose an alternative, general-purpose, software technology for supporting application-to-application communication. Problems of EDI, of process-to-process communication, and of describing information items are discussed in terms of the communication problems they present. We then justify the need for this kind of software and lay out the criteria (or plausibility conditions) for evaluating a proposal for this sort of system software. The use of a formal communication language is proposed as a common solution to these problems. This proposal is examined in the context of the EDI problem, in order to demonstrate how the proposal might work in practice. Practical benefits of the proposal are discussed that highlight the impact such a technology might have on business practices. The proposed solution is measured against the plausibility conditions presented earlier in the paper; it is found to be sufficient in some cases and in need of further investigation in others. We then discuss the industrial-organizational implications of the availability of such a technology, and hypothesize that it would affect the number and form of cooperative business relationships as well as their scope and depth.

This study examines the impact of socialization practices on the nature of this role adjustment with respect to information systems professionals. One hundred and sixty newly hired IS personnel in five different cities were surveyed to examine the relationship between organizational socialization tactics and adjustment variables such as role orientation, role ambiguity, and role clarity. Results suggest that socialization practices affect professional role adjustment. Specifically, institutionalized socialization tactics lead to a custodial role orientation and individualized socialization tactics produce an innovative role orientation. In addition, institutionalized tactics are shown to reduce role ambiguity and role conflict in new employees.

The increasing globalization of business has led firms to seek new, and more appropriate, organizational structures, processes, and cultures. This has required the establishment of appropriate information technology platforms to coordinate business processes and to provide coalition mechanisms. This study is based on five important dimensions of transnational strategy--the configuration of value chain activities, the coordination of value chain activities, centralization, strategic alliances, and market integration--that define a comprehensive taxonomy of transnational strategy. A basic proposition is that a firm's transnational strategy will be reflected in the design of its information systems. To address this proposition, a two-stage questionnaire study was conducted. Respondents included 150 multinational corporations from 20 countries and 25 industries. The five dimensions of transnational strategy were operationalized, and the analysis established the validity of a taxonomy that is better suited to the study of systems-related issues in MNCs. This taxonomy was used to test hypotheses related to the organization of transnational systems. These hypotheses were stated in terms of IS organizational, strategic, architectural, and personnel dimensions. The results of the study support the proposition that the organizational characteristics of centralization, dispersal, and coordination are differentially reflected in the IT configurations of various kinds of MNCs. In a centrally coordinated business structure, IT is also globally centralized. In addition, local autonomy was shown to affect the deployment of IT in global firms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1999,4,7,28

A comprehensive list of potential facilitators and inhibitors for the strategic use of information technology was derived from past research and used as the basis for collecting data from 121 firms. These data were factor-analyzed to determine the key underlying dimensions of facilitators and inhibitors. On the basis of the resulting seven dimensions, stepwise discriminant analysis was used to compare companies that have used IT applications for strategic purposes and companies that have not done so. The results suggest that innovative needs, competitive position, environment, economies of scale, and top management guidance are the most important facilitators, while the lack of IT drivers, the lack of economies of scale, and the lack of innovative needs are the most important inhibitors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1996,4,35,53

We differentiate e-commerce assets that are the focus of a sourcing decision in terms of whether they are in the growth or maturity stages. We also consider hybrid governance mechanisms, such as minority equity arrangements, as a potential sourcing mode in addition to the conventional distinction between insourcing (i.e.. hierarchical governance) and outsourcing (i.e., market governance). The rapid evolution in e-commerce technologies and their markets during this period allows us to test whether asset maturity plays any role in sourcing decisions. Results indicate that when the strategic intent of an e-commerce project is more business focused during the growth phase, hybrid governance is preferred over hierarchical governance for sourcing of e-commerce assets. Strategic intent is found not to influence sourcing mode choices during the technology/market maturity phase. Hierarchical governance is the preferred sourcing mode during the growth phase, when task complexity is high. For managing task complexity, as technologies and their markets mature, both hierarchical and hybrid governance modes become preferable to the market governance mode.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,47,82

We present three changes of perspective based on these principles, which can be used to formalize the underlying mechanisms of idea generation techniques. The paper shows how these three principles can be used to improve Generate thinkLets and discusses how this formalization can improve the applicability of information systems for ideation processes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,85,114

Consequently, the competitive dynamics of online sales are affected in markets where price-comparison shopping is diffusing rapidly. We develop a dynamic competitive pricing model that deals with an asymmetric duopolistic market where the segment sizes are determined through a diffusion process. Our diffusion-of-innovations approach allows us to dynamically capture the proportion of informed and uninformed customers in a homogenous goods market. We use this model to analyze how strategic profit-maximization behavior evolves over time. This analysis shows that the increasing numbers of price-comparison shoppers pull prices down, and the rate at which prices decrease is shaped by the diffusion curve and brand preference. Our analysis shows that stores with loyal customers, or with a preference for their brands, can attain higher profits further into the diffusion process. The direct implication is that firms should use their information technology, operations, and marketing capabilities to create, enhance, and cultivate stronger preferences for, and loyalty to, their brand names to survive the inevitable information-rich markets of tomorrow.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,99,119

This paper critiques and empirically evaluates four approaches to the measurement of outputs. Two of the metrics, raw function counts and function points, are based on the function point analysis methodology pioneered by Albrecht and Gaffney at IBM. The second two, object counts and object points, are based on a new approachâ€”object points analysisâ€”that is introduced here for the first time. The latter metrics are specialized for output measurement in object-based CASE environments that include a centralized object repository. Estimation results for nineteen large-scale CASE projects show that the new metrics have the potential to yield equally accurate, yet easier to obtain estimates than function points-based measures.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,3,127,150

Recently, however, interaction designs that focus on communicating abstract consumer needs have been suggested as a promising alternative. This paper investigates how temporal distance moderates the effectiveness of these two competing IDA communication designs by its effect on consumersâ€™ mental representation of the product decision problem. Temporal distance is inherently connected to IDAs in two ways. Congruency between consumption timing (immediate versus distant) and IDA communication design (concrete versus abstract, respectively) increases the likelihood to accept the IDAâ€™s advice. This effect is also achieved by congruency between IDA process timing (immediate versus delayed delivery of recommendations) and IDA communication design (concrete versus abstract, respectively). We further show that this process is mediated by the perceived transparency of the IDA process. Managers and researchers need to take into account the importance of congruency between the user and the interface through which companies interact with their users and can further optimize IDAs so that they better match consumersâ€™ mental representations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,231,260

Structural equation modeling results indicate that the online shopping channel supported the overall decision-making process. In particular, we found strong support for the design and choice phases of online consumers' decision-making process. Our results also indicate that support for the decision-making process was mediated by the cost savings and time savings gained by the online consumers and led to their greater channel satisfaction.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,115,135

To empirically address this issue, we apply a Web-based questionnaire with adaptive conjoint measurement. By cluster analysis, we identify four competence profiles preferred by team members. Data from 176 respondents suggest that experience is related to the preferred profile, whereas expertise is related to overall competence valuation. Our research suggests that immature teams should consider that preferences regarding IT professionals may change with venture maturation, whereas interdisciplinary teams should discuss each member's value contribution.

The method employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) and nonparametric production frontier hypothesis testing to determine whether the performance of restaurants that have deployed Positran is better, on average, than for those that have not. The design of the study is of special interest, because it approximates a controlled experiment. Our results show that Positran helped to reduce input materials costs, since restaurants that deployed the technology were less likely to be inefficient. It is further possible to characterize the class of restaurants for which the relationship holds.

Perceived usefulness and user satisfaction, in turn, affect knowledge use, which in our model is a measure of how well knowledge sharing and reuse activities are internalized by an organization. Our model includes organizational support structure as a contributing factor to the success of KM system implementation. Data collected from 150 knowledge workers from a variety of organizations confirmed 10 of 13 hypothesized relationships. Notably, the organizational support factors of leadership commitment, supervisor and coworker support, as well as incentives, directly or indirectly supported shared knowledge quality and knowledge use. In line with the proposed model, the study lends support to the argument that, in addition to KM systems quality, firms must pay careful attention to championing and goal setting as well as designing adequate reward systems for the ultimate success of these efforts. This is one of the first studies that encompasses both the supply (knowledge contribution) and demand (knowledge reuse) sides of KM in the same model. It provides more than anecdotal evidence of factors that determine successful KM system implementations. Unlike earlier studies that only deal with knowledge-sharing incentives or quality of shared knowledge, we present and empirically validate an integrated model that includes knowledge sharing and knowledge quality and their links to the desired outcome--namely, knowledge reuse.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,3,309,347

Verbeek,Dynamic Work Distribution in Workflow Management Systems: How to Balance Quality and Performance, metrics for work distribution;  workflow management;  workflow systems,"Today's workflow management systems offer work items to workers using rather primitive mechanisms. Although most workflow systems support a role-based distribution of work, they have problems dealing with unavailability of workers as a result of vacation or illness, overloading, context-dependent suitability, deadlines, and delegation. As a result, the work is offered to too few, too many, or even the wrong set of workers. Current practice is to offer a work item to one person, thus causing problems when the person is not present or too busy, or to offer it to a set of people sharing a given role, thus not incorporating the qualifications and preferences of people. Literature on work distribution is typically driven by considerations related to authorizations and permissions. However, workflow processes are operational processes where there is a highly dynamic trade-off between quality and performance. For example, an approaching deadline and an overloaded specialist may be the trigger to offer work items to less qualified workers. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a systematic approach to dynamically create a balance between quality and performance issues in workflow systems. We illustrate and evaluate the proposed approach with a realistic example and also compare how a workflow system would implement this scenario to highlight the shortcomings of current, state of the art workflow systems. Finally, a detailed simulation model is used to validate our approach.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,157,193

The model incorporates the characteristics of an ISSC portfolio relative to the threat and business environments and includes the type of attack, frequency of attacks, possible damage, and the extent and time of recovery from damage.

This paper argues that SNTs also contribute to good negotiation decisions because PNTs and SNTs are closely interlinked in the form of causal relationships. Moreover, B2B negotiation demands a practical and useful framework that can reuse past negotiation knowledge and perform â€˜what-ifâ€™ analysis. This paper proposes a framework that consists of formalization, reuse, and problem-solving phases. The framework first formalizes TAKBN (tacit knowledge about B2B negotiation) with both PNTs and SNTs using a cognitive map and case-based reasoning, then stores them in case bases as cases that can be retrieved for later use and problem solving. This framework provides a platform with which decision makers can study past B2B negotiation cases, apply them to current B2B negotiation problems, and simulate different negotiation situations before making decisions. The framework has been tested using two practical scenarios. A structured, 13-item questionnaire was rigorously developed and applied to evaluate the validity of the proposed framework based on 16 B2B negotiation experts' judgments. Statistical tests proved that the proposed framework could improve decision performance significantly in B2B negotiations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2006,4,337,376

Using data from U.S. manufacturing industries, we find that industries receive significant IT spillover benefits in terms of total factor productivity growth through economic transactions with their respective supplier industries. More importantly, we find that two characteristics of downstream industries, namely, IT intensity and competitiveness, which have been shown to moderate the effect of internal IT investments, play an important role in IT spillovers as well. Our results suggest that IT intensity as well as competitiveness of the downstream industry moderate the effect of IT spillovers-industries that are more IT intensive and more competitive benefit more from IT spillovers. Finally, our results suggest that the long-term effects of spillovers are greater than short-term effects, suggesting that learning periods are required to reap the benefits from the IT spillovers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,115,145

Our model yields several propositions that suggest the appropriate strategic actions that a firm may take when there is potential for IOS adopters to question whether adopting the IOS will be value-maximizing. We analyze and illustrate the related strategic thinking in a real-world context involving a financial risk management IOS. We present a case study of the ownership and spin-off of RiskMetrics, developed by New York City--based investment bank, J.P. Morgan, in the late 1980s. The firm first gave RiskMetrics to its correspondent banking, treasury, and investment clients for free, in the context of its clearing account relationship services. Later, the bank spun off the product to an independent company that offered fee-based services. We model the bank's clients in terms of their heterogeneous portfolio risks, and their effects on the value a client can gain from adopting the technology. We also examine the value they may lose if their private portfolio risk information is exploited. A key roadblock to the adoption of the free service may have been the potential for strategic information exploitation by the service provider. When Morgan spun off RiskMetrics with multiparty ownership, wider adoption occurred. Our theory interprets this strategic move as an appropriate means to maximize long-term profits when information exploitation may occur.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,2,109,135

Despite growing interest in information technology-enabled IPNs, the literature has been silent in exploring the various ontological structures of IPNs and the structural efficiency embedded in each IPN, especially in the event of radical organizational changes. To fill this gap, this study identifies, from the perspective of graph theory, four ontological IPN archetypes that can serve as blueprints for information processing within and across organizations--random, small world, moderate scale free (MSF), and Barabasi. We then assess how each structure reacts to corporate restructuring (e.g., downsizing) and investigate, based on computer simulation, the extent to which each structure preserves a worker's efficiency and the stability of the network structure in the event of downsizing. Two moderating variables are included in the model--that is, scale of downsizing and the reconnection strategy in the presence of downsizing. In this study, downsizing is viewed not only as the simple elimination of individual workers but also as the elimination of the communication and information- processing conduits necessary for effective communication and coordination. We find that when firms implement a relatively small-scale workforce reduction, centralized coordination structures such as MSF and Barabasi are generally more resilient and facilitate better coordination. However, when the downsizing strategy involves massive and severe layoffs, decentralized coordination structures such as random and small world are more durable, and tend to provide a stronger safety net, irrespective of the strategies employed to create new ties. Although this study focused exclusively on the context of downsizing, the results of the study have important implications for other types of organizational restructuring (e.g.,",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,1,201,231

Using simultaneous equation models and data from 243 hospitals, we find that the effects of security resources vary for data breaches and perceived compliance and that security operational maturity plays an important role in the outcomes. In operationally mature organizations, breach occurrences hurt compliance, but, surprisingly, compliance does not affect actual security. In operationally immature organizations, breach occurrences do not affect compliance, whereas compliance significantly improves actual security. The results imply that operationally mature organizations are more likely to be motivated by actual security than compliance, whereas operationally immature organizations are more likely to be motivated by compliance than actual security.

Then, we examine the impact of the structure variables on the perceived effectiveness of a subunit of lS--software development--using ""task"" as the contextual contingency influencing this relationship. Organizational information processing theory provides the theoretical foundation for this study. Analysis of data from thirty hospital reveals that a contingency relationship exists between task context and structural dimensions of software development subunits in determining their effectiveness. Task complexity and decision-making structure in interaction exhibit a nonmonotonic effect on the software development subunit's effectiveness. While the interaction of subunit work flow interdependence with both decision-making structure and control structure was significant, the direction of effect was unexpected. Implications of these findings for practicing managers, and IS planners and researchers are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,3,157,181

However, excessive electronic integration can be dysfunctional too. We make a conceptual argument that more is not always better and that the fit between contextual factors and electronic information sharing should be achieved to seek optimal channel performance. We empirically examine the fit between electronic information transfer (EIT) and contextual factors of a supply channel, our specific contribution being the assessment of fit in terms of multivariate congruence. The data required for this field study was collected from 124 managers/buyers responsible for supplier relationships in six multinational enterprises in two different industries (automobile and heavy shipbuilding) headquartered in Korea. The results ratify our hypothesis that multivariate congruence between EIT components and supply-channel contextual factors indeed exists. Follow-up drill-down analysis indicates that the monitoring component of EIT has a significant influence on demand uncertainty, and complexity-in-use is influenced by the coordination aspect of EIT. However, both the coordination and monitoring aspects of EIT are significantly relevant to interdependence of partners in a supply channel. A post hoc exploratory analysis suggests that the supply-channel performance is influenced by the fit between the contextual factors and the channel design factors. An inference of practical value that emerges from our findings is that more or less electronic integration is not the real issue. What is critical is the fit between supply-channel context and the level of electronic integration.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,293,320

The disparity between the interest in and adoption of qualitative approaches may be attributed to unfamiliarity with qualitative approaches for analyzing text data and the mistaken belief that all qualitative approaches are antipositivist. This paper makes qualitative methods more accessible to both researchers and practitioners by providing a framework that categorizes various text analysis approaches. The framework classifies methods as positivist, linguistic, and interpretivist, based on assumptions about the nature of text data, the researcher's influence on text interpretation, and the validity checks used to justify text interpretations. Thus, all researchers can consider qualitative text analysis methods regardless of their paradigmatic position.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,2,137,155

Freimer,The Disruptive Effect of Open Platforms on Markets for Wireless Services, net neutrality;  nonlinear pricing;  open platforms;  quasi-bundling;  wireless services,"Application-based pricing is common in telecommunications. Wireless carriers charge consumers more per byte of traffic for text messages than they do for wireless surfing or voice calls. Such pricing is possible because carriers and handset manufacturers have the ability to tag and meter each application. While tagging and metering are possible in the case of closed platforms such as iPhone, they are not in the case of open platforms such as Android. Android is open source with open application programming interfaces, and anyone can develop applications for it. Because the carriers have little control over applications, Android is inherently disruptive of differential pricing across applications. Users and neutrality advocates support Android, believing that it can increase consumer surplus by disrupting differential pricing. However, we show that the equilibrium under differential pricing is different from the equilibrium under open platforms, and it is particularly so with regard to the sets of consumers served and the quantities consumed. With open platforms, certain consumers are either not served or they are served a quantity that is less than what they would be served under differential pricing. Consequently, the consumer surplus and the social surplus are often lower with open platforms. Similarly, firms are expected to prefer differential pricing. We show that this expectation is also not true under certain circumstances in which open platforms and neutral pricing work like a quasi-bundle.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,81,110

Inferring from the review the need for computer support for negotiation, the paper then proposes a theory for understanding the effects due to a support system in a two-party, monolithic, and multiple-issue setting. The theory conceptualizes a negotiation support system as consisting of individual decision support systems interconnected with an electronic communication channel; accordingly, it postulates two sets of effects, one owing to the decision aid, and the other to the communication support.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,3,27,44

However, offering training programs and enabling access to facilities are not sufficient on their own if, due to other reasons, the socially disadvantaged groups do not choose to make use of the facilities. As an exploratory investigation, this study focuses on the voluntary adoption of these facilities (typified by the Internet) by one such disadvantaged groupâ€”older adults. In particular, this study investigates the role of Internet self-efficacy and outcome expectations in older adults' usage of the Internet through a three-part longitudinal study, involving almost 1,000 participants. A theoretical model based on social cognitive theory was developed and empirically tested through both surveys and lab experiments. Behavioral modeling training courses were offered to adults age 55 or older in the study over a one-year period. Questionnaire surveys and cognitive knowledge assessments were conducted. In general, the findings in the longitudinal study (including three repeated measures) validated the affects of Internet self-efficacy and outcome expectations on usage intention, and the important roles of support and encouragement in the formation of self-efficacy and outcome expectations. Limitations and implications are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2006,4,177,206

It seeks to show that the effects of GDSS on decision-making processes and outcomes are task-structure-dependent, and the effects of GDSS cannot be evaluated on the basis of outcomes alone; decision processes must also be evaluated in order to understand how decisions are made and why GDSS can improve group outcomes in some situations but provide negative effects in others. A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted with a 2 x 3 factorial between-subjects design, manipulating two independent variables: levels of support (GDSS support and no support) and task structures (additive, disjunctive, and conjunctive). Practicing managers were chosen as subjects. The discussion records of the decision-making process were coded using a coding scheme. These communication patterns formed the first dependent variables. Another dependent variable was decision quality. The results support the hypothesis that the structures of a decision task moderate the effects of GDSS on both the patterns of group communication and the decision quality of a decision-making group. GDSS significantly improve decision quality in disjunctive and conjunctive tasks. GDSS also significantly alter patterns of group communication in disjunctive and conjunctive tasks. However, no significant differences in decision quality and patterns of group communication exist between groups using GDSS and face-to-face groups in additive tasks.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1997,4,193,215

This paper examines a real-world example from the field of finance to illustrate a comparison of alternative modeling tools. Two modeling alternatives are used in this example: regression analysis and neural network analysis. There are two main results: (1) Linear regression outperformed neural nets in terms of forecasting accuracy, but the opposite was true when we considered the business value of the forecast. (2) Neural net-based forecasts tended to be more robust than linear regression forecasts as data accuracy degraded. Managerial implications for financial risk management of mortgage-backed security portfolios are drawn from the results.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,1,11,32

We describe a monopolistic pricing scheme for distributing digital content over P2P networks that rewards peer users who actively participate in the distribution process. Our results show that digital distribution through a P2P network is more profitable and more efficient than in the corresponding client-server setting, if the pricing mechanism used provides strong incentives to users to share content. The basic results hold when the model is extended to include time-variant preferences across generations of consumers, and when the monopolist performs price discrimination based on generations. Some practical implications from the theoretical analysis are also discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,121,139
856, Nancy Lankton;  Joan Luft,Uncertainty and Industry Structure Effects on Managerial Intuition About Information Technology Real Options, behavioral finance;  IT investment;  real options theory,"Real options analysis is an important but costly tool for valuing many information technology (IT) investments. As a low-cost substitute for real options--based methods, firms often depend on managerial intuition, which sometimes approximates real options--based valuations and sometimes does not. Making good choices about how to value IT investments requires an understanding of why, and therefore when, intuitive judgment is more or less likely to be consistent with real options--based valuations. Field and survey studies have provided ex post observations of systematic variations in consistency by option type, but ex ante hypotheses explaining this variation have been rare. This study uses two behavioral economic theories to predict option-type-specific differences between intuitive judgments and real options prescriptions. Regret theory posits that individuals will value decision outcomes based on both the expected utility of payoffs and on anticipated regret for not having made an alternative decision. As a consequence, intuitive IT investment decisions are less aggressive as uncertainty increases (higher valuation of deferral options, lower valuation of growth options), in contrast to higher normative values for both real option types with higher uncertainty. Consistent with competitive behavior theories that predict overaggressive behavior to contest market behavior, intuitive IT investment decisions are more aggressive in the presence of a potential competitor (lower valuation of deferral and higher valuation of growth options), holding constant the normative value of the options. We present experimental evidence consistent with these predictions. An important implication of our results is that future research should not test for general consistency between intuitive judgment and real options theory, but should identify and explain systematic variation in consistency across option types and settings. Such variation is important in practice because it determines when intuitive judgment is and is not likely to be an adequate substitute for costly formal real options valuation. It also determines when training in real options concepts needs to be more intensive to overcome inconsistency with intuitive judgment, and when the outputs of formal real options valuation are likely to be unintuitive and thus not readily acceptable to managers with limited option theory training.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,2,203,240

Larsen,A Taxonomy of Antecedents of Information Systems Success: Variable Analysis Studies, antecedents of success;  information systems implementation;  quantitative research;  taxonomy,"Research in the information systems (IS) field has often been characterized as fragmented. This paper builds on a belief that for the field to move forward and have an impact on practitioners and other academic fields, the existing work must be examined and systematized. It is particularly important to systematize research on the factors that underlie success of organizational IS. The goal here is to conceptualize the IS success antecedents (ISSA) area of research through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating the work in the domain. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, a taxonomy of 12 general categories is created, and existing research within each category is examined. Important lacunae in the direction of work have been determined. It is found that little work has been conducted on the macro-level independent variables, the most difficult variables to assess, although these variables may be the most important to understanding the ultimate value of IS to organizations. Similarly, ISSA research on success variables of consequence to organizations was found severely lacking. Variable analysis research on organizational- level success variables was found to be literally nonexistent in the IS field, whereas research in the organizational studies field was found to provide useful directions for IS researchers. The specifics of the 12 taxonomy areas are analyzed and directions for research in each of them provided. Thus, researchers and practitioners are directed toward available research and receive suggestions for future work to bring ISSA research toward an organized and cohesive future.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,2,169,246

The results indicated that middle managers responsible for implemented business innovation also generated IT innovation while managers' practical (hands-on or delegated) use of IT was not shown to result in more implemented IT innovation. Middle managers who actively used support functions (secretaries, staff, or IT experts) for help and discussion of IT-related issues created and implemented a greater amount of IT innovation. Implemented business and IT innovations related to the variables of attitude toward change and peer recognition for their implemented innovations but not to internal and external networking.

This highlights the importance of understanding and managing the relationship between information technology and organizational change. This study takes a new look at an old concept: information system utilization. A theoretical framework grounded in the punctuated equilibrium model contends that the mutual adaptation of commercial software packages and organizational processes follows a discontinuous change pattern where stable periods of utilization are occasionally disturbed by internal and external change triggers. Qualitative data gathered from interviews with software vendor personnel and a representative sample of users provide preliminary support for the existence of utilization equilibrium states. The evidence suggests that, when significant changes occur in the appropriation of technology, the users, or the organization context, the existing equilibrium state is disturbed. Following a temporary transition state characterized by redefinition of the technology and/or its context, the changes are incorporated into altered work processes, and a new equilibrium state develops. Various factors associated with the creation, maintenance, and disruption of equilibrium states are identified. Managers and users can enhance and prolong the useful life of software packages by paying careful attention to implementation efforts that heavily influence initial utilization equilibrium, identifying periods of equilibrium and transition, and managing the internal and external change triggers that influence transitions between equilibrium states.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,2,63,90

Although parametric learning methods have been proposed for acquiring the preference information of negotiation opponents, these methods suffer from the strong assumptions about the specific utility function and negotiation mechanism employed by the opponents. Consequently, it is difficult to apply these learning methods to the heterogeneous negotiation agents participating in e-marketplaces. This paper illustrates the design, development, and evaluation of a nonparametric negotiation knowledge discovery method which is underpinned by the well-known Bayesian learning paradigm. According to our empirical testing, the novel knowledge discovery method can speed up the negotiation processes while maintaining negotiation effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonparametric negotiation knowledge discovery method developed and evaluated in the context of multi-issue bargaining over e-marketplaces.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,79,103

SISP is an important activity for helping information executives and top management identify strategic applications and align IT with business needs. Previous researchers and practitioner observers have identified measures of successful SISP and have recommended many prescriptions for achieving success. In this research, the SISP experiences of 105 planners contribute a new perspective on these prescriptions and the success of SISP. Planners extensively follow the prescriptions that promote the efficient management of the SISP study. Although they also extensively follow those prescriptions that lead to their own greater satisfaction, they do not so rigorously follow those that meet SISP objectives. However, the fit between information technology capabilities and the needs of the organization is important to them. Furthermore, plan implementation remains critical to meeting SISP objectives. Combined, these generalizations suggest the central contribution of this research-planner's paradox: The planner must complete the SISP study rapidly to facilitate its implementation but in doing so risks compromising its fit to the organization and therefore reduces its chances of implementation. The planner must thus plan rapidly enough to produce the plan quickly but carefully enough to produce a relevant one.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,1,35,62
865, Gaurav Bansal;  Atish P. Sinha;  Huimin Zhao,Tuning Data Mining Methods for Cost-Sensitive Regression: A Study in Loan Charge-Off Forecasting,,"Real-world predictive data mining (classification or regression) problems are often cost sensitive, meaning that different types of prediction errors are not equally costly. While cost-sensitive learning methods for classification problems have been extensively studied recently, cost-sensitive regression has not been adequately addressed in the data mining literature yet. In this paper, we first advocate the use of average misprediction cost as a measure for assessing the performance of a cost-sensitive regression model. We then propose an efficient algorithm for tuning a regression model to further reduce its average misprediction cost. In contrast with previous statistical methods, which are tailored to particular cost functions, this algorithm can deal with any convex cost functions without modifying the underlying regression methods. We have evaluated the algorithm in bank loan charge-off forecasting, where underforecasting is considered much more costly than overforecasting. Our results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average misprediction costs of models learned with various base regression methods, such as linear regression, model tree, and neural network. The amount of cost reduction increases as the difference between the unit costs of the two types of errors (overprediction and underprediction) increases.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,315,336

This paper presents a study that examines the relationship between the use of an important class of IT, communications technologies, and organizational structural attributes within a broad contingency context. Hypotheses are proposed, based on theory from the information-processing paradigm examining the mediating role of communications technologies (CT) in the relationship between environmental characteristics and organizational structural characteristics.

Prior research suggests that setting a publicly announced limit on resources can make individuals less willing to escalate their commitment to a failing course of action. However, the relationship between initial budget and schedule goals and software project escalation remains unexplored. Drawing on goal setting theory as well as sunk cost and mental budgeting perspectives, we explore the effect of goal difficulty and goal specificity on software project escalation. The findings from a laboratory experiment with 349 information technology professionals suggest that both very difficult and very specific goals for budget and schedule can limit software project escalation. Further, the level of commitment to a budget and schedule goal directly affects software project escalation and also interacts with goal difficulty and goal specificity to affect software project escalation. This study makes a theoretical contribution to the existing body of knowledge on software project management by establishing a connection between goal setting theory and software project escalation. The study also contributes to practice by highlighting the potential negative consequences that can result from the nature of initial budget and schedule goals that are established at the outset of a project.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,53,78

The emerging technology of logic programming provides a suitable implementation language for this approach.

A prototype expert system is described that utilizes deontic rules for reasoning about normative constraints in organizations and other social systems. Applications to bureaucracies and electronic contracting systems are discussed. DX can be used to model regulations and policies in organizations, such as library regulations of universities, resource access policies, and the like. Also, regulatory aspects in interorganizational systems (e.g., EDI) can be effectively modeled and managed by DX.

However, extant research in this context has not paid much attention to usability design of a virtual world and corresponding effects on users' psychological desire to own and control the space and objects within it and subsequent behavior intention. In this study, we apply concepts of Web site usability and psychological ownership to develop a model that illustrates the relationships between seven usability factors (legibility, firmness, coherence, variety, mystery, classic, and expressive visual aesthetics), four antecedents of psychological ownership (cognitive appraisals, perceived control, affective appraisals, and self-investment), psychological ownership, and use intention. A cross-sectional study with 239 Second Life users was conducted. The results demonstrate that designing a usable virtual world that induces strong psychological ownership is crucial to attract users to spend more time, participate in more activities, and revisit the virtual world. This is an important finding for forward-looking e-business managers looking to invest their limited resources in designing a usable virtual world. In addition, by using our model and corresponding survey items, designers can benchmark and evaluate the usability of their current virtual worlds, compare the results to the designs of competitors, and upgrade the offerings of virtual worlds, as needed, by allocating available resources to the most influential design factors to suit their specific needs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,3,269,308

Adam;  Aryya Gangopadhyay;  James Clifford,A Form-Based Approach to Natural Language Query Processing, database management systems;  complementarity;  natural language interfaces;  query processing,"We describe a methodology for processing data retrieval and update queries using a form-based natural language interface. For the purpose of illustration, we use computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) as the application domain. The interface consists of a set of fourth-generation interface tools (SQL forms), a set of form definitions, a lexicon, and a parser. The forms are developed from the functional and data models of the system. A form definition consists of a form name, a form object, a set of form fields, and a set of fragment grammars. A form object is a single or composite entity that uniquely identifies a form. Form fields consist of database fields whose values can be entered by users (user-defined), and others whose values can be derived by the system (system-defined). Fragment grammars are templates that identify the information requested by user queries. The lexicon consists of all words recognized by the system, their grammatical categories, synonyms, and associations (if any) with database objects and forms. The parser scans a natural language query to identify a form in a bottom-up fashion. The information requested by the user query is determined in a top-down manner by matching the fragment grammars associated with a form against the user query. Extragrammatical inputs with limited deviations from the grammar rules are supported. Elliptical queries are supported by deriving the missing information from those specified in previous queries and forms. Combining a natural language processor with SQL forms allows update queries and prevents violation of database integrity constraints, duplication of records, and invalid data entry.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,2,109,135

Consumers desire exactly one of the many service classes offered. We call such a setting a vertically integrated online services market. Examples of these services are webcasting of special events over the Internet, provision of video-on-demand, and allocation of grid computing resources. We model the pricing and allocation decision faced by firms in such a setting as a knapsack problem with an added preference elicitation dimension. We present a variety of computational solution approaches based on adaptations of the traditional greedy heuristic for knapsack problems. The solution approaches vary in efficacy depending on whether bidders are restricted to bid in one service class or allowed to bid in multiple service classes, as well as on the overall variability of the demand. In the case bidders can bid in multiple classes but are interested in consuming only one service class, a direct application of the heuristics developed for the single service case results in a nonfair allocation.

There are two types of free trials: (1) freeware, which consists of very basic features of focal software without a time lock, and (2) trialware, which has the full functionality of focal software with a time lock. In this paper, we study what factors make some free-trial software attract more potential adopters than others. Our empirical model under the traditional Bass-type diffusion examines the effects of the different types of free-trial software and ratings on consumer software sampling and reveals the dynamics of sampling over time. Using free-trial software downloading data on Download.com, we observe that the consumer software sampling process can be described by the theory of information diffusion. We find that user ratings affect sampling performance positively and that third-party ratings need to be positive to be effective. Finally, our results do not show any discernible differences between freeware and trialware with regard to their impact on sampling performance. This study contributes to the understanding of software free-trial practice from the perspective of consumer sampling growth of different types of free trials. Our findings can help design free-trial strategies to extrapolate the extent of consumer awareness of focal software and effectively convey its quality information to potential customers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,3,213,246

The study analyzes data quality activities at five organizations via a five-year longitudinal study. The study finds that experienced practitioners solve data quality problems by reflecting on and explicating knowledge about contexts embedded in, or missing from, data. Specifically, these individuals investigate how data problems are framed, analyzed, and resolved throughout the entire information discourse. Their discourse on contexts of data, therefore, connects otherwise separately managed data processes, that is, collection, storage, and use. Practitioners, context-reflective mode of problem solving plays a pivotal role in crafting data quality rules. These practitioners break old rules and revise actionable dominant logic embedded in work routines as a strategy for crafting rules in data quality problem solving.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,3,93,119

We investigate whether a certain mode of knowledge, knowing-why, affects work performance and whether the knowledge held by different work roles matters for work performance. We operationalize these questions in the specific domain of data production processes and data quality. We analyze responses from three roles within data production processes, data collectors, data custodians, and data consumers, to investigate the effects of different knowledge modes held by different work roles on data quality. We find that work roles and the mode of knowledge do matter. Specifically, data collectors with why-knowledge about the data production process contribute to producing better quality data. Overall, knowledge of data collectors is more critical than that of data custodians.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,3,13,39

The literature in this area suggests that there should be a relationship between organizational size and administrative innovation. Empirical studies of information system use have found that in the context of medical information systems, there seems to be a relationship between size and computer use. A recent paper by Gremillion in JMIS reported empirical evidence that the two variables are independent, contrary to the results predicted by established theory. This paper presents the results of a study intended to provide confirmatory evidence of this lack of relationship when some of the constraints of Gremillion's study are relaxed. The results suggest a significant relationship between organizational size and information system sophistication, although this relationship may be muddied by technical and organizational factors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,2,1985,3,78,86

Trust is an especially relevant success factor in online health-care communities. A look at existing communities leads to the conclusion that many VCs fail to meet requirements upon which trust is established. Based on the findings in the literature and the researchers' experience, this paper describes how trust-enabling functionalities can be systematically designed and implemented in a VC for cancer patients. Consequently, the outcomes of these design measures are evaluated. The evaluation results show that supporting trust can be achieved following a two-step model. The presented components support the perceived competence and perceived goodwill of the operators and the other members. Perceived goodwill and competence then support the process of creating and sustaining trust between members as well as between members and the operators of the VC and contribute to the successful implementation and maintenance of the community. The paper concludes with a discussion on further trust-supporting components yet to be implemented and gives recommendations for further research in this area.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2005,4,101,135

We proceeded to evaluate the outcomes of these design measures and found that participation can be supported using a two-step model. The components of the model support incentives and motives of users. Incentives and motives of the users then support the process of activation and consequently participation throughout the ideas competition. This contributes to the successful implementation and maintenance of the ideas competition, thereby providing support for the development of promising innovative ideas.

Previous research has focused almost exclusively on query languages with little concern for how database structure is represented. This paper reports on an experiment that explores the influence of database structure representation on the ability of users to learn and use a database system. Four alternative representations of the same databases are developed and compared. These representations differ in semantics, symbols, and means of representing relationships. Interestingly, representation features that aid in communicating the contents of a database appear to hinder the learning of the SQL query language.

Complexities of IT projects along with the effect of project interdependencies raise several challenges in applying real options for prioritization of IT investments. We examine a large U.S.-based energy utility firm in a deregulated environment that is considering investment in a portfolio of 31 projects to provide a range of Internet-enabled energy services to customers. Using real data on expected project benefits and costs for different competitive scenarios, we develop a nested options model that extends prior research by incorporating the impact of project interdependencies to calculate the option value of all projects. Our nested options model provides a better understanding of project interdependencies on valuation and prioritization decisions, and provides insights into the business value of IT infrastructure projects that provide the managerial flexibility to launch future projects.

The question addressed in this paper is what are the underlying factors that affect which transactions are likely to be supportable by B2B exchanges. In particular, we identify and study three factors: supplier management, idiosyncratic investments in information systems, and codifiability (i.e., digitalizability) of product and order-fulfillment specifications underlying transactions. We show that transaction codifiability plays a fundamental role in influencing the nature of sustainable contracting and IT investments in e-markets. Hypotheses are derived from an analytical model of codifiability in e-marketplaces; these hypotheses are supported by several case studies by the authors and others on the key success factors underlying B2B exchanges.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,2,77,98

Drawing on Bourdieu's practice theory, we argue that the production of any practice involves varying degrees of embodiment (i.e., relying on personal relationships) and objectification (i.e., relying on the exchange of objects). We subsequently characterize boundary-spanning practices according to their relative degrees of embodiment and objectification. We distinguish between â€˜market-likeâ€™ boundary-spanning practices, which rely primarily on an objectified mode of practice production, from â€˜community-likeâ€™ practices, which involve mostly the embodied mode of practice production. IT is then conceptualized as a medium for sharing objects in the production of practices. As such, IT use allows for the sharing of objects without relying on embodied relationships. We use data from an in-depth ethnographic case study to investigate how IT was used to transform community-like boundary-spanning practices within an organization into market-like ones. Moreover, we demonstrate how, as IT was used to support the exchange and combination of depersonalized objects, other aspects of the practice (such as the roles of intermediaries and the nature of meetings) also changed. The related changes in these diverse aspects of a boundary-spanning practice supported the trend toward greater objectification. IT use also increased visibility of the terms associated with object exchange. This increased visibility exposed the inequity of the exchange and encouraged the disadvantaged party to renegotiate the relationship.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2006,4,13,37

Much of the theory and practice of organizational IT implementation assumes that organizational decisions--whether technical or social--are consequences of individuals and organizational units objectively collecting, evaluating, and applying information in a rational manner to make choices on behalf of the organization. However, recent data from case studies on IT implementation suggest that rationality may be the exception, rather than the rule. One important limitation, then, of traditional research and systems analysis methods is that they fail to account for the human factors that impact IT implementation. As a result, there is no systematic way to incorporate what we might learn from individual action and practice into the model. A theoretical perspective and research methodology that successfully encompass and expand the normative approach in mainstream science is ""action science."" Action science is a theory of action that helps explain how, and why, individuals behave as they do; and how their actions impact their organizations. In this paper, our primary goal is to employ an action science perspective to understand how a large financial services firm was inhibited from implementing a major IT effort in a timely, effective, and error-free way because of the thought and action routines of those charged with designing and implementing the system. In particular, we look for disagreements and other, unproductive action routines among these individuals, and evidence of their inability to surface and discuss them. We also review two published studies of IT implementation to show that the level of analysis required by action science is implied, but not made explicit in them. We conclude with a discussion of what constitutes a descriptively adequate account of an IT implementation and the barriers to the production of such an account. We also suggest a competing framework, based on action science, for designing and managing organizational IT change.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,2,55,73

Information technology (IT) researchers generally have followed the general trend by providing structural-functional accounts of politics, power, and control strategies. Although such studies underscore the importance, nature, and complexity of politics in IT implementation, they are constrained by the lack of both a general theory of human behavior as well as a model of power that bridges the individual actor and the wider interpersonal/organizational setting. In this paper we present a case study of power and politics in a large financial transactions company, but seen through the lenses of the action science perspective of Argyris and his associates and the model of power developed by A.A. Berle. More specifically, we examine the power vacuum in the IT effort that resulted from the senior executive abrogating his power and failing to delegate it to his subordinates. The resulting political havoc, in turn, caused competition and confusion, wasted effort, and a significant lack of productivity with regard to the implementation of a multimillion-dollar IT effort. We conclude with several hypotheses about how principles of action science and interpersonal power must be used by executives to manage the politics of IT design and implementation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,3,115,133

Several studies have been conducted of how MKISs are used in the Fortune 500 companies, and the authors compare their current findings to those of ten and eighteen years ago. It seems that both the MKIS support and the model use for the three levels of marketing management are more balanced today than ten years ago. Moreover, pricing decisions instead of product decisions are taking the lead in using the MKIS services today. Marketers have been taking advantage of developments in technology and methodology to increase the level of decision support since the 1960s. However, there is a lack of satisfaction with the MKIS among marketers today. Many firms are not linking their marketing plans with theft companywide information system plans to create competitive advantages. Under today's intense global competition, these situations must be rectified as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will definitely create pressures that could either increase the role of the marketing information system in these firms, or eliminate it entirely.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,1,165,192

Because of the unavoidable incompleteness of labor contracts, managers with misaligned incentives and budgetary discretion could entrench themselves through their non-value-maximizing adoption decisions. In order to boost their bargaining power in future contract renegotiation, they invest excessively in technologies they manage more effectively than their potential rivals. In addition, they tend to adopt technologies that can create large information asymmetries giving them significant knowledge advantage over their potential rivals ex post. We study the implications and effects of their rent-seeking behavior within the context of organizational IT adoption and management. The efficacies and the limitations of formal incentive contracting are discussed to underscore the need for additional governance mechanisms. While knowledge management may mitigate some of the agency problems associated with entrenchment, managerial self-policing issue remains a challenge.

We develop a theoretical framework for the antecedents and performance outcomes of production outsourcing at the plant level. We validate this theoretical framework using cross-sectional survey data from U.S. manufacturing plants.

Using a patent classification task as an example, we represent knowledge evolution processes with patent citations and introduce a labeled citation graph kernel to classify patents under a kernel-based machine learning framework. In the experimental study, our proposed approach shows more than 30 percent improvement in classification accuracy compared to traditional content-based methods. The approach can potentially affect the existing patent management procedures.

It is commonly understood that online reviews can reduce consumer uncertainty about product characteristics and, therefore, have the potential to increase product demand and firm profits. However, when considering repeat purchase products, online reviews have an additional effect in that they can alter consumersâ€™ propensity to switch among products, which can intensify price competition and lead to lower profits. The strength of these potentially offsetting effects depends on the informativeness of consumer reviews, which is a function of both objective review accuracy and the ability of consumers to obtain information from reviews when their idiosyncratic preferences over product characteristics might differ from the preferences of reviewers. The interplay of these competing effects results in an Sâ€‘shaped relationship between the quality of reviews and firm profits. There exists an optimal level of consumer informedness from the firmsâ€™ perspective, and competing firms may have incentives to facilitate consumer reviews in some markets but not in others. Given firmsâ€™ strategic pricing, consumers may also be worse off as review informativeness increases.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,9,41

The proposed approach has other appealing features, such as facilitating cost-benefit analyses to help promote efficient ISS risk management. The paper elaborates the theoretical concepts and provides operational guidance for implementing the method. The method is illustrated using a hypothetical example from the perspective of management and a real-world example from the perspective of external assurance providers.

While this strategy has been justified on the grounds that dynamic IT capabilities are durably heterogeneous, there does not seem to be empirical evidence supporting or refuting this assumption. This study empirically validates the assumption of durable heterogeneity of dynamic organizational IT capability (ITC) due to path dependence. We capture ITC heterogeneity by introducing a framework in which firms try to achieve ITC leadership in their industry and we propose that durable ITC heterogeneity can be attributed to path dependence, and hence, it can be tested using Heckman's true state dependence of ITC leadership status. Using random and fixed effect dynamic logit models, we investigate true state dependence of ITC leadership on a sample of large U.S. firms. The results, which are robust to alternative sample, dependent, and control variable specifications, show that achieving ITC leadership is a true state-dependent process, suggesting durable heterogeneity of ITC due to path dependence. The study contributes to the dynamic capabilities literature and has important managerial implications. The proposed framework for conceptualizing durable resource heterogeneity due to path dependence is general and versatile, thus providing a foundation for future research on dynamic capabilities. The findings provide empirical evidence to confirm that ITC is durably heterogeneous and should be managed as a potential source of competitive advantage.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,3,45,84

Wirjanto,Sustainability of a Firm's Reputation for Information Technology Capability: The Role of Senior IT Executives, external legitimacy;  institutional theory;  internal legitimacy;  IT capability reputation;  IT executives;  IT strategic leadership;  reciprocity;  structural power,"This study investigates the development and sustainability of a firm's information technology (IT) capability reputation from an IT executive's standpoint. Building on institutional theory, we argue that IT executives will try to achieve external legitimacy (i.e., project an image of superior IT capability to external stakeholders) in the hope that the top management team and board members will reciprocate by elevating the internal legitimacy of IT executives. Firms that develop such a culture of reciprocity with their IT executives are more likely to sustain their IT capability reputation. Econometric results based on panel data for 1,326 large U.S. firms from a wide spectrum of industries over a 13-year period (1997-2009) validate these predictions. More specifically, we find that IT executives with greater structural power (e.g., higher job titles) or IT-related expert power (e.g., IT-related education or experience) are more likely to attract public recognition for their firm's IT capability. Firms that build such an IT capability reputation are more likely to promote their IT executives, and IT executives who are promoted are more likely to stay longer with their firms. This continuity in IT strategic leadership is positively associated with the firm's ability to sustain its IT capability reputation. Our findings have important practical implications related to a firm's IT reputation strategy as well as the motivation and career of IT executives. Firms wanting to develop and sustain their IT capability reputation would do well to foster the creation of a cycle of positive reciprocity with their IT executives. IT executives hoping to increase their power within their firm's top management team and improve the legitimacy of the firm's IT organization need to project an image of IT superiority to external stakeholders.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,57,96

Comprehending text-based information requires intensive cognitive processing effort on the part of readers. Drawing on multimedia literature, this study identified a characteristic of multimedia presentations, namely complementary cues, which have the potential to improve the comprehensibility of organizational information. A set of hypotheses about the benefits of multimedia over text-based presentations was generated based on the theoretical perspective that we developed. These predictions were tested through a laboratory experiment using a simulated multimedia intranet. Results show that multimedia facilitates the retention and subsequent recall of explanative information but not of descriptive information. Explanative information is organized facts connected by their underlying functional relationships. Descriptive information consists of isolated facts without an explanation of the relationships between these facts. The ability to retain and recall explanative information, in turn, leads to a greater ability to make correct inferences about new organizational situations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,1,99,127

Drawing from the literature on trust, we developed a model of how trustbuilding strategies could affect trust and the consequences of trust. We investigated two trust-building strategies: portal association (based on reputation categorization and trust transference) and satisfied customer endorsements (based on unit grouping, reputation categorization, and trust transference).A series of two studies was conducted at a large public university in Hong Kong. The first study employed a laboratory experiment to test the model in an online bookstore environment, using a real task that involves actual book purchases. Of the two strategies investigated, satisfied customer endorsement by similar peers, but not portal association, was found to increase consumers' trusting beliefs about the store. This, in turn, positively influenced consumers' attitudes toward the store and their willingness to buy from the store, which ultimately led to actual buying behaviors. To gather further insights on the two Web strategies investigated, a second study was conducted using a questionnaire survey approach. Overall, the findings corroborated those in the first study. Specifically, it shows that endorsements by similar (local, nonforeign) peers, but not by dissimilar (foreign) peers, were effective means of developing trust among first-time visitors to online stores.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,2,233,266

This question takes on paramount importance with information technology innovations that lead to new products and services that exhibit network effects. This paper explores the impact of network effects on the licensing choice. The literature suggests that without network effects, a royalty license is preferred by producer-innovators. We find that a fixed-fee license is optimal with strong network effects. For less intense network effects, the optimal license uses a royalty rate, either alone or in combination with a fee. We further derive the terms of the optimal license and discuss the impact of the investment needed to replicate the innovation and the size of the potential market. Our results provide insights for licensing decisions in industries that exhibit network effects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,2,91,118

In this paper, we address the challenges of these business model strategies and compare different ad revenue models. We use game theory to model vertical differentiation in both monopoly and duopoly settings, in which online service providers may offer an ad-free service, an ad-supported service, or a combination of these services. Offering both ad-free and ad-supported services is the optimal strategy for a monopolist because ad revenues compensate for the cannibalistic effect of vertical differentiation. In a duopoly equilibrium, exactly one firm offers both services when the ad revenue rate is sufficiently high. Furthermore, we find that a higher ad revenue rate may lead to lower service prices. Consistently across both monopoly and duopoly settings, such price reductions are more severe in the cost-per-thousand-impressions model than in the cost-per-click model. Our findings emphasize the role of advertising revenues in vertical differentiation and offer strategic guidance for monetizing online services.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,195,236

We model the innovation race among sellers in both finite and infinite horizons. In the finite case, we analytically show that the platform's optimal seller-side access fee fully extracts the sellers' surplus, and that the optimal buyer-side access fee mitigates price competition among sellers. The platform's optimal strategy may be to charge or subsidize buyers depending on the degree of variation in the buyers' willingness to pay for quality; this optimal strategy induces full participation on both sides. Furthermore, a wider quality gap among sellers' products lowers the optimal buyer-side fee but leads to a higher optimal seller-side fee. In the infinite innovation race, we perform computations to find the stationary Markov equilibrium of sellers' innovation rate. Our results show that when all sellers innovate, there exists a parameterization under which a higher seller-side access fee stimulates innovation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,171,202

However, given the performance of the state-of-the-art speech recognition technology today, widespread acceptance of speech recognition technology would not be realistic without designing and developing new approaches to detecting and correcting recognition errors effectively. In seeking solutions to the above problem, identifying cues to error detection (CERD) is central. Our survey of the extant literature on the detection and correction of speech recognition errors reveals that the system-initiated, data-driven approach is dominant, but that heuristics from human users have been largely overlooked. This may have hindered the advance of speech technology. In this research, we propose a user-centered approach to discovering CERD. User studies are carried out to implement the approach. Content analysis of the collected verbal protocols lends itself to a taxonomy of CERD. The CERD discovered in this study can improve our knowledge on CERD by not only validating CERD from a user's perspective but also suggesting promising new CERD for detecting speech recognition errors. Moreover, the analysis of CERD in relation to error types and other CERD provides new insights into the context where specific CERD are effective. The findings of this study can be used to not only improve speech recognition output but also to provide context-aware support for error detection. This will help break the barrier for mainstream adoption of speech technology in a variety of information systems and applications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2006,4,237,270

Previous studies in the management information systems literature emphasized extrinsically motivated content (addressing tangible gains), while many sites target intrinsic goals such as entertainment or education. This study examines potential factors influencing willingness to pay for intrinsically motivated online content. Data from 392 college students indicate that even when analyzing content whose potential rewards are intangible and nonquantifiable, potential consumers focus on ""expected benefits"" as the main antecedent for willingness to pay. Other antecedents, such as perceived quality and provider reputation, only affected willingness to pay indirectly through expected benefits.

Such self-disclosure (SD) behavior is generally considered positive and beneficial in interpersonal communication and relationships. Using a newly proposed model based on social exchange theory, this paper investigates and empirically validates the relationships between SD technology use and culture. In particular, we explore the effects of culture on information privacy concerns and the desire for online interpersonal awareness, which influence attitudes toward, intention to use, and actual use of SD technologies. Our model was tested using arguably the strongest social computing technology for online SDâ€” instant messaging (IM)â€”with users from China and the United States. Our findings reveal that cross-cultural dimensions are significant predictors of information privacy concerns and desire for online awareness, which are, in turn, found to be predictors of attitude toward, intention to use, and actual use of IM. Overall, our proposed model is applicable to both cultures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of the effects of culture and privacy concerns on SD technologies and provide practical suggestions for developers of SD technologies, such as adding additional control features to applications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,163,200

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and similar international laws now require firms to establish whistle-blowing (WB) procedures and WBRSs, increasing the importance of WB research and applications. Although the literature has addressed conventional WB behavior, it has not explained or measured the use of WBRSs in online contexts that could significantly alter elements of anonymity, trust, and risk for those using such reporting tools. This study proposes the WBRS model (WBRS-M). Using actual working professionals in an online experiment of hypothetical scenarios, we empirically tested the WBRS-M for reporting computer abuse and find that anonymity, trust, and risk are highly salient in the WBRS context. Our findings suggest that we have an improved WB model with increased explanatory power. Organizations can make WB less of a professional taboo by enhancing WBRS users' perceptions of trust and anonymity. We also demonstrate that anonymity means more than the mere lack of identification, which is not as important in this context as other elements of anonymity.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,153,190

Already we have seen the computer science discipline embrace the challenges of finding new directions in design science toward making services-oriented computing approaches more effective, setting the stage for the development of a new science--service science, management, and engineering (SSME). This paper addresses the issues from the point of view of service science as a fundamental area for IS research. We propose a robust framework for evaluating the research on service science, and the likely outcomes and new directions that we expect to see in the coming decade. We emphasize the multiple roles of producers and consumers of services-oriented technology innovations, as well as value-adding seller intermediaries and systems integrators, and standards organizations, user groups, and regulators as monitors.

We explicate the computer-mediated communication (CMC) interactivity model (CMCIM) to explain and predict how interactivity enhances communication quality that results in increased process satisfaction in CMC-supported work groups. We operationalize this model in the challenging context of very large groups using extremely lean CMC. We tested it with a rigorous field experiment and analyzed the results with the latest structural equation modeling techniques. Interactivity and communication quality dramatically improved for very large groups using highly lean CMC (audience response systems) over face-to- face groups. Moreover, CMC groups had fewer negative status effects and higher process satisfaction than face-to-face groups. The practical applications of lean CMC rival theoretical applications in importance because lean CMC is relatively inexpensive and requires minimal training and support compared to other media. The results may aid large global work group continuance, satisfaction, and performance in systems, product and strategy development, and other processes in which status effects and communication issues regularly have negative influences on outcomes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,1,155,195

We also extend information integration theory to explain how branding alliances are able to increase initial trust and transfer positive effects to Web sites. Testing of our model shows that the most important constructs for increasing initial trust in our experimental context are branding and Web site quality.

Web traffic also affects brand awareness and customer acquisition, and is a predictor of the performance of a firm's stock in the market. The information systems and accounting literature have treated buzz and traffic separately in studying their relationships with firm performance. We consider the interactions between buzz and traffic as well as competitive effects that have been overlooked heretofore. To study the relationship between user-initiated Web activities and firm performance, we collected a unique data set with metrics for consumer buzz, Web traffic, and firm value. We employed a vector autoregression with exogenous variables model that captures the evolution and interdependence between the time series of dependent variables. This model enables us to examine a series of questions that have been raised but not fully explored to date, such as dynamic effects, interaction effects, and market competition effects. Our results support the dynamic relationships of buzz and traffic with firm value as well as the related mediation effects of buzz and traffic.

Based on a panel data set of 744 individual consumers collected from Yelp, we used the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method to develop and empirically test a system of simultaneous models of consumer review behavior. Our results reveal that male reviewers or those who lack experience, geographic mobility, or social connectedness are more prone to being influenced by prior reviews. We also found that longer and more frequent reviews can reduce online reviews' biases.

This requires multiple databases to work together. We refer to this category of information systems as Composite Information Systems (CIS). Migrating from separate systems to a more fully integrated CIS environment is usually a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process both due to technical and organizational realities. An evolutionary approach is presented in this paper to meet the challenge. The essence of this approach is captured in four CIS principles: (1) the separation of data from processing; (2) the use of flexible tools; (3) the use of interfaces that facilitate data conversion and communication between processing components and databases; and (4) the explicit recognition of the ClS environment. Based on these principles, we delineate five stages of evolution, which may co-exist: (1) separate systems; (2) virtual-driver; (3) logical separation; (4) physical separation; and (5) specialized functional engine. The opportunities for strategic uses of information technology in organizations are often blocked by the difficulties of getting from the current state to the desired situation.

Drawing from social network and technology use literature, we examine how the structure of a team's advice-seeking network affects individual use of a newly implemented information technology. We develop cross-level hypotheses related to the effects of the structure of mutually interconnected ties within the team (i.e., internal closure) as well as the structure of nonredundant ties outside the team boundaries (i.e., external bridging). The hypotheses are tested in a field study of 265 employees working in 44 teams in a large financial services institution. Results show that internal closure has a U-shaped effect on individual use such that individual usage of the system is higher when the number of internal advice-seeking ties within the team is low or high, suggesting that medium levels of internal closure are the least desirable network configurations because in such instances teams neither realize the benefits of high closure information sharing nor are they able to avoid in-group biases associated with low closure conditions. Our results also reveal that in addition to having a direct positive effect on individual use, external bridging interacts with internal closure in a complex manner. The U-shaped effect of closure is dominant when bridging is high but assumes an inverted U-shaped pattern when bridging is low. Several implications for managers follow from these findings. First, in order to increase usage of technology, in teams characterized by low internal closure, managers should encourage the development of ties across team boundaries. Second, managers should maximize within-team interconnections in order to facilitate the circulation of external knowledge within team boundaries. Finally, managers should be aware that maximizing internal closure by facilitating interconnections among team members could be dangerous if not accompanied by mechanisms for external bridging.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,3,9,42

Mann,Measuring the Organizational Impact of Information Technology Investment: An Exploratory Study, information technology investment;  investment-performance analysis;  organizational strategic and economic performance,"Organizations are investing ever-increasing amounts in information technology (IT). However, the existing literature provides little evidence of a relationship between IT investment and organizational strategic and economic performance. The exploratory research reported here appears to be the first to relate comprehensive sets of IT investment measures to organizational strategic and economic performance measures. Although the individual IT investment variables were found to be only weakly related to organizational strategic and economic performance, they were significantly related to performance when grouped and analyzed by means of canonical correlation. More specifically, canonical results suggest that organizational strategic and economic performance measures such as sales by employee, return on sales, sales by total assets, return on investment, and market to book value are affected by IT investment measures such as IT budget as percentage of revenue, the percentage of IT budget spent on training of employees, number of PCs per employee, and IT value as a percentage of revenue. The organizational performance measure growth in revenue and IT investment measure percentage of IT budget spent on staff were not significantly related to other measures and therefore were not indicated to be useful for investigating possible effects of IT investment on organizational strategic and economic performance. Finally, a model based on these results is suggested. The model depicts a framework for management evaluation of the relationship between IT investment and organizational performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,1,97,122

The study was motivated by the recent interest in user satisfaction as a surrogate measure of IS organizations' successful performance. The research found a significant relationship between the user satisfaction variables and the Nolan benchmark maturity variables. While the individual maturity variables were found to be weak predictors of the user satisfaction variables, when both sets of variables were grouped accordingly, canonical analysis revealed a significant predictive relationship between the Nolan maturity variables and the level of user satisfaction. Further research based on the findings of the study is suggested as a means of improving the degree of relationship between maturity criteria and users' satisfaction variables.",Journal of Management Information Systems,2,1985,3,37,64

Menon;  Sumit Sarkar,No Free Lunch: Price Premium for Privacy Seal--Bearing Vendors, partial least squares modeling;  price dispersion;  privacy assurance;  risk premium;  trust,"Privacy is a significant concern of customers in the business-to-consumer online environment. Several technical, economic, and regulatory mechanisms have been proposed to address online privacy. A current market-based mechanism is the privacy seal, under which a third party assures adherence by a vendor to its posted privacy policy. In this paper, we present empirical evidence of the effect of displaying a privacy seal on the product prices of online vendors of electronic books, downloadable audiobooks, and textbooks. Using data collected on these relatively homogeneous products sold by online vendors, we find that while controlling for vendor-specific characteristics, vendors bearing privacy seals charge a premium for such products compared to vendors not bearing a seal. The paper provides empirical evidence of the economic value of privacy assurance from the customers' perspective as measured by the price premium charged for products. The research has implications for researchers and policymakers by providing evidence that privacy is another factor that creates friction in e-commerce, and that prices on the Internet for homogeneous products need not converge.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,189,212

We explore the problem of making databases self-descriptive. We first examine the levels of semantics of data by analogy to the area of programming languages. Next, we consider several semantic data models, which are formal languages for conceptual data description, and how a semantic description can be linked to the objects in a database. We discuss the advantages of making a semantic description part of a database itself and the types of application programs that would use that description. In particular, we focus on PIQUE, a high-level relational query language that uses such semantic information.",Journal of Management Information Systems,1,1984,1,33,49

A process by which emerging information technologies may be effectively identified and evaluated is rapidly becoming a necessity. This process may be accomplished through scanning the external IT environment.

This study uses data from 131 top information systems managers to examine differences in the three types of organizations across a number of issues concerning the process of scanning the external IT environment. These issues include: (1) the objectives of scanning the external IT environment; (2) the methods of scanning the external IT environment; (3) the existence of separate units dedicated to IT scanning; (4) the level of IT scanning intensity; (5) the sources of information used for IT scanning; and (6) the level of top management involvement with IT scanning.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,2,177,200

Jarvenpaa,Safe Contexts for Interorganizational Collaborations Among Homeland Security Professionals, dual process theories;  geographic proximity;  knowledge protection;  personal networks;  safe contexts;  security professionals,"In many domains of increased turbulence and volatility, interorganizational ad hoc collaborations are common. One such domain is homeland security in which security professionals collaborate virtually with individuals outside of their own organizations in response to a security threat. In such a domain, a safe context is needed to ensure that interactions with collaborators not only help to solve the immediate threat but also avoid the improper use by outside parties of information released during these collaborations. We use the heuristic systematic model of information processing to hypothesize that the relationship between different safe context factors and a security professional's perceptions of collaboration success will be contingent on differences in geographic proximity of the collaborating parties--differences in proximity that are not related to differences in physical face-to-face contact but to differences in social proximity. Our exploratory empirical investigation finds support for the hypothesized interaction effect: safe contexts that require deeper processing are related to higher levels of perceived success when the parties are geographically proximal (with no differences in face-to-face contact), whereas safe contexts that involve heuristic-based processing are related to success when parties are geographically less proximal. Our findings suggest that the utility of safe context factors is contextualized based on the proximity of interacting parties, that geographical proximity's social space dimension plays a key role independent of differences in physical face-to-face contact, and that, practically, to be successful, ad hoc collaborators should have access to a range of safe context factors, using them in different combinations depending on the proximity of network members.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,55,86

These decisions have a substantial effect on the profitability of the firm and account for much time and effort of senior management. This research investigates the effect of problem structuring and modeling with a GDSS on coordinated decision-making of managers in a group faced with a mixed-motive production-planning task. In a laboratory experiment, a GDSS with features supporting problem modeling is contrasted with a GDSS without such features. The results indicate that the groups using a GDSS with a problem-modeling tool outperformed the groups using a GDSS without a problem-modeling tool, but they were less efficient with respect to the time and number of messages it takes the group to converge to a final solution. User confidence in the solution did not differ between the two groups. The results of this study indicate that the problem modeling feature of a GDSS significantly influences group decision process and outcomes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,259,282

Because voluntary systems require users' volitional behavior, researchers have traced recent implementation failures to a lack of user commitment. However, gaps in our understanding of volitional usage behavior and user commitment have made it difficult to advance theory, research, and practice on this issue. To validate a proposed research model, cross-sectional, between-subjects, and within-subjects field data were collected from 714 users at the time of initial adoption and after six months of extended use. The model explained between 44.1 percent and 58.5 percent of the variance in adoption and usage behavior based upon direct effects of user commitment. Findings suggest that user commitment plays a critical role in the volitional acceptance and usage of such systems. Affective commitment--that is, internalization and identification based upon personal norms--exhibits a sustained positive influence on usage behavior. In contrast, continuance commitment--that is, compliance based upon social norms--shows a sustained negative influence from initial adoption to extended use. Theory development based upon Kelman's social influence framework offers new empirical insights about system users' commitment and how it affects volitional usage behavior.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,1,117,151

A clear understanding of this issue requires a precise distinction between mandatory and volitional behaviors. Consistent with organismic integration theory (OIT), this study situates the locus of user motivations inside the user. Drawing upon an endogenous view of behaviors, this research makes three key contributions. First, it develops the theoretical basis for clearly discerning if and when behavior results from perceived external influences or from personal volition. Specifically, it examines how endogenous psychological feelings of autonomy, freedom, conflict, and external pressure can predict and explain user intentions. Second, it proposes that behavior may result from combinations of perceived external influences and personal volition. Recognizing how such ""collections of motivations"" together influence behavior advances our understanding beyond the ""dichotomy"" of extrinsic versus intrinsic motivations often adopted in prior research. Third, it proposes that some desired behaviors may be thwarted or impeded by a conflict between perceived external influences and personal volition. The theoretically grounded research model was empirically validated in a field study on Blackboard, a Web-based education platform at a large university. Data collected from a sample of 211 users were tested using structural equation models of initial system adoption and experienced use. Empirical support was found for the proposed model and related hypotheses. The results of this study advance our understanding about user motivations for adopting IT.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,267,299

Here, we address two key questions related to the effect of technology in platform markets. First, how does technology asymmetry affect competition between platforms? Second, how does it affect the incentives for platforms to collaborate? Using a game-theoretic model of a two-sided market where technology strongly influences network value, we show that small asymmetries in platform technologies can translate into large differences in their profitability. We find that technology improvements by the inferior platform do not significantly increase its profits, but can reduce opportunities for fruitful cooperation, since collaboration is less likely in markets with closely matched competitors. We also show that collaboration is most profitable when it takes the form of direct network interconnection. Interestingly, collaboration may provide incentives for a dominant platform to accommodate entry, where it would not otherwise do so.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,2,109,140

948, Salvatore T. March;  John V. Carlis,On the Interdependencies between Record Structure and Access Path Design, record segmentation;  access paths;  physical database design,"The physical organization of data within a database has two major components: record structures and access paths. Record structures specify the grouping of data items into data records that are physically stored and accessed together. Access paths specify the algorithms and system data used to determine the physical location of data records and to efficiently support content-dependent searching. Choosing efficient record structures and access paths is complicated by the fact that they are interdependent. This paper formalizes these interdependencies and proposes an approach to solving the combined record structure-access path design problem. This work extends an existing database design system in four ways: (1) record segmentation is extended to include redundantly stored data in any number of independently processed segments; (2) dependent access paths are added allowing us to design multiple, interrelated file organizations at the same time; (3) new methods are proposed to assist in the generation of potentially useful record structures; and (4) inter-file organization performance constraints can be specified.",Journal of Management Information Systems,4,1987,2,45,73

Through this metadata we define the ""state"" of the information resource. We characterize a set of dimensions for metadata and discuss its representation and management. Concepts from Information Resource Dictionary Systems (IRDS) are described as they support metadata management. We include IRDS contents, capabilities, and implementation issues.

This paper focuses on investments that firms can make to reduce buyers' uncertainty about taste-related product attributes. Using an analytical model, we show that firms should disclose more taste-related information when the customer segment they directly target represents a larger share of the overall market. We further show that there are practical ways by which managers can decide if such disclosure investments are financially beneficial to their firms. Specifically, we show that the variance of consumer reviews can guide such decisions. The paper's main contribution to the extant literature is to show that firms must consider the variance, but not the mean, of buyer reviews, to determine the need to invest in reducing consumer uncertainty about taste-related attributes. The papers's findings are managerially important due to the ubiquity of consumer reviews. They are novel because most of the previous literature views the mean of the review as the key indicator. Finally, they are general in their applicability since they are independent of any assumptions about heuristics that buyers may use to ascertain product quality from the reviews of previous buyers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,2,269,299

Synthesis of evidence from a wide variety of sources suggests four distinct types of knowledge reuse situations according to the knowledge reuser and the purpose of knowledge reuse. The types involve shared work producers, who produce knowledge they later reuse; shared work practitioners, who reuse each other's knowledge contributions; expertise-seeking novices; and secondary knowledge miners. Each type of knowledge reuser has different requirements for knowledge repositories. Owing to how repositories are created, reusers' requirements often remain unmet. Repositories often require considerable rework to be useful for new reusers, but knowledge producers rarely have the resources and incentives to do a good job of repurposing knowledge. Solutions include careful use of incentives and human and technical intermediaries.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,1,57,93

Because the governance of interorganizational arrangements is believed to affect their efficiency and effectiveness, this paper explores how and why interorganizational coordination hubs are governed. Analysis of relevant prior theory and case examples shows that coordination hub governance is designed to balance the sometimes conflicting needs for capital to invest in new technology, for participation of industry members, and for the protection of data resources. Findings suggest that the governance of interorganizational coordination hubs is not the starkly categorical choice between collective (member-owned) and investor-owned forms as suggested by prior theory. Instead, many hybrid arrangements are observed in the five examined cases. Future theoretical development and empirical research are needed to understand the increasingly important phenomenon of coordination hub governance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2012,4,163,198

An alternative strategyâ€”profit-maximizing systems development life cycle (PMAX-SDLC)â€”is proposed which is based on the use of process models. These models have their origin in the economics literature and were developed to accurately characterize engineering production processes.

Prior research has called for a deeper understanding of how managers can encourage greater innovation with technology in the workplace. Drawing on the team climate and technology use literatures, we identify team learning climate and team empowerment climate as key factors that affect employees' propensity to explore a new system's features. We develop and test our use in a field study involving 268 employees embedded in 56 work teams. Three main findings come out of this research. First, the results reveal that the two types of team climate differ in their cross-level effects on individual intention to explore, such that team learning climate promotes greater intention to explore, whereas team empowerment climate reduces employees' intention to explore the technology. In addition, we find that team learning climate and team empowerment climate interact in shaping individual intention to explore, such that the presence of a strong learning climate is more effective in promoting intention to explore when teams also have a strong empowerment climate. Second, the findings show that men and women are affected differently by team climate. We find that for men, team empowerment climate has no influence on intention to explore, whereas for women there is a significant negative cross-level effect. Finally, we find that intention to explore has a positive effect on usage scope, suggesting an important link between team climate, individual cognition, and the scope of features used by employees in team settings. Taken together, the model and results highlight the important role of team climate and gender-and the interplay between them-as drivers of technology feature exploration. Our findings, especially those related to team empowerment climate, are counterintuitive when compared to prior literature and offer useful insights for managers. On the one hand, managers should consider leveraging team learning climate to intrinsically stimulate employees to engage in exploration of technology. On the other hand, managers should be cautious and guard against saddling employees with too many additional responsibilities during the stages of exploration and experimentation with system features. It is possible that through an expanded set of responsibilities and expectations fostered by team empowerment climate, employees may be experiencing work overload, thus reducing their likelihood of exploring a broader set of technology features. Managers should be especially attentive to this based on the gender composition of their teams.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,79,114

Through a case study, we illustrate the proposed PCD methodology as applied to the fuzzy front-end and additionally illustrate how electronic performance support technology can be utilized to support the fuzzy front-end process.

We report on the results of an experiment consisting of 35 virtual project teams comprised of 175 members residing in the United States and Japan. Through content and cluster analysis, we identify distinct patterns of interaction and examine how these patterns are associated with differential levels of GVPT performance. We also explore the role of temporal coordination mechanisms as a means to synchronize temporal patterns in GVPTs. Our results suggest that successful enactment of temporal coordination mechanisms is associated with higher performance. However, we found that temporal coordination per se is not the driver of performance; rather, it is the influence of coordination on interaction behaviors that affects performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2003,4,129,155

The failure occurred despite the fact that the venture had many components crucial to success, including a proprietary intellectual property position, enormous market demand, a well-qualified, committed team, and sufficient funding. One reason for this failure is the lack of information flows among several parties critical to the success of the venture. This case suggests that in software markets that operate at breakneck pace and have short development cycles, effective information flow is a first-order priority. These blockages in information flows can stem from the nature of the cultures that are created to produce software ideas, especially proprietary technologies. The case also suggests that information can be affected by the clash between U.S. software market characteristics and Japanese business culture. Fortunately, there are inexpensive solutions that can substantially improve the return on investment, especially foreign investment, in new software technologies.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,2,23,39

This has led researchers to investigate the contexts within which user participation can be used to improve user satisfaction. This study builds on this past body of research by examining the relationship between specific user participative behaviors and user satisfaction in different contextual situations in order to identify the most successful participative behaviors. To do this, data were collected from 151 independent system development projects in eight different organizations. The context of development was described by two factors--task complexity and system complexity. As suggested in the literature, the combination of these two contextual factors determine the need for user participation. The relationship between specific participative behaviors and user satisfaction was then examined where the need for participation was high and those results were compared with situations with a lower need for participation. Not all participative behaviors were equally effective in all situations. Depending on the level of task complexity and system complexity, some user participative behaviors resulted in improved user satisfaction, while others had no relationship with satisfaction. The results add to earlier studies by identifying those specific user participative behaviors most beneficial under different contexts. The implications apply to both practitioners involved in the development of systems and academicians seeking to explain where and how user participation should be used. Strategies based on the results are suggested for the most appropriate involvement for users during system development.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,2,133,150

Adopting a profile deviation perspective of fit, the outcome of a software development project (Performance) is hypothesized to be influenced by the fit between the project's risk (Risk Exposure) and how project risk is managed (Risk Management Profile). The research model was tested with longitudinal data obtained from project leaders and key users of 75 software projects. The results support the contingency model proposed and suggest that in order to increase project performance a project's risk management profile needs to vary according to the project's risk exposure. Specifically, high-risk projects were found to call for high information processing capacity approaches in their management. However, the most appropriate management approach was found to depend on the performance criterion used. When meeting project budgets was the performance criterion, successful high-risk projects had high levels of internal integration, as well as high levels of formal planning. When system quality was the performance criterion, successful high-risk projects had high levels of user participation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2001,4,37,69

Although the recent downturn in the economy might have temporarily eased the IT labor shortage, issues of recruitment and retention of qualified personnel are key to the success of IS development projects. This study presents a model of the combination of CASE tool usage and job satisfaction as related to internal career orientation. Two hypotheses based on this model were tested using empirical evidence collected through a survey method. The first examines whether the career orientation of IS personnel influences their job satisfaction. The second incorporates the impact of CASE tool usage on this relationship. The results indicate that in a CASE tool environment, personnel with a predominant technical career orientation have more job satisfaction than those with a predominant managerial orientation. However, there is a significant and positive synergy between the sophistication of the CASE tool used and managerial competence orientation leading to higher job satisfaction. These findings indicate that combating the IT personnel shortage through task automation may also increase worker satisfaction, thereby decreasing turnover. Careful selection of the CASE tool for use may result in this win-win situation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,2,273,302

This cross-cultural field study was an exploratory investigation of the effects of ""national culture"" (U.S. and Mexican) upon group consensus levels and perceptions of participation equity and satisfaction within GSS environments and non-GSS (manual) environments. Within both the U.S. and Mexican cultures, results indicate no significant differences in consensus levels between GSS and manual treatments. However, both U.S and Mexican groups generated significantly greater relative changes in consensus levels using GSS technology versus manual technology. Comparison between cultures shows that Mexican groups generated higher levels of consensus than U.S. groups with main effects due to culture and experimental treatment (i.e., GSS support). While U.S. group participants reported no differences in satisfaction among experimental treatments, Mexican participants reported higher satisfaction levels using GSS-supported environments. In a similar pattern, U.S. participants reported no differences in perceived participation equity between treatments, while Mexican GSS participants reported higher participation equity than Mexican manual participants.

Knowledge acquisition has been regarded as the bottleneck in knowledge-based systems development. In this paper, a distributed knowledge acquisition system (DKAS) is introduced for automating decision rules construction from a set of examples in a decision support system. DKAS has the potential to include various learning mechanisms and employs a multi-agent and parallel processing paradigm. The implementation of a DKAS integrates inductive and deductive learning methods that use different learning strategies. A stock selection problem is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of DKAS in solving classification type problems. The performance of the DKAS in portfolio management is compared to the performance of the NYSE and the S&P; 500.

To examine this, a laboratory experiment examining the influence of group history (i.e., established versus ad-hoc groups) and the level of computer support (i.e., communicating via a computer-mediated system versus face-to-face) was conducted. Dependent variables examined in the research include information-sharing performance, decision quality, and member perceptions. Subjects completed a hidden profile task--a task where some information is held by all group members prior to the meeting, while other information is held only by a subset of the group. As expected, established groups discussed less unique information than ad-hoc groups. In addition, information sharing was positively related to the quality of group decisions. Members of established groups were more satisfied than members of ad-hoc groups; members using the computer-mediated system were less satisfied than those communicating face-to-face. In addition, group cohesion was positively related to satisfaction and decision quality. The results are discussed in the context of prior theory and research.

One type of IS is representative of information technology (IT) used in primary, clinical, value-chain activities, and the other is representative of the IT used in support (administrative) value-chain activities. The model innovation is that it accommodates up to a seven-year lag for each type of IS. The output variables for the production function are hospital output and medical labor productivity. Using data spanning from 1979 to 2006 from several hospitals, it was found that clinical IS improve hospital output in the short run (of two years). Administrative IS were found to be negatively associated with organizational performance in the short run, but positively associated with these performance measures over the long run (over four years). These results highlight the importance of timing IT investments and the sequencing chosen for the implementation of IS presenting various value-chain activities, and the resulting pattern of business value over time. Differential lag length of the types of IS is to be considered in estimating the rate of return of new IT projects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,1,297,316

We develop a model to examine optimal strategies for media providers to utilize the online channel to distribute digital media. We examine a number of options for media providers. Our results suggest that media companies should sell programs online when content quality is relative high and online access cost is low. When online access cost is relative high, media providers could use the advertising strategy. Overall, companies are better off providing both pricing and advertising options to consumers. We derive the optimal price and advertising level, and analyze the factors that affect the price and advertising decisions. We find that as advertisement revenue rate increases, advertising level should be kept low. In addition, media companies should set online price and advertising level with consideration of the traditional channel in order to avoid channel cannibalization. We also analyze the advertising level in the traditional channel. Our results suggest that as digital video recorder technologies provide more convenience to consumers, media companies should increase, rather than decrease, revenues from advertising.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,143,166

In the market, users can access a repository of knowledge for a single price (repository pricing) or knowledge items in the repository can be sold individually (knowledge pricing). However, users have been found to prefer repository pricing but not the knowledge in the repository. This irrationality can cause market failure because users derive a suboptimal level of utility from the knowledge repository, and vendors have contradictory pricing and knowledge strategies. We empirically examine a joint explanation from two competing theoretical perspectives that accounts for this inconsistency nicely: The mental accounting perspective endorses repository pricing because it entices users with the benefits of the whole repository, whereas the transaction decoupling perspective finds expression in individually priced knowledge because it prevents the discrete benefit of knowledge from becoming obscure. By integrating the two theoretical perspectives and considering price, knowledge, and user characteristics simultaneously, the results offer important implications for the market transfer of knowledge. Repository pricing attracts users and is essential to initiate the transfer process, whereas knowledge pricing generates knowledge preference and is thus an effective approach for learning.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,79,108

Outcomes explored were the groups' satisfaction with the decision made and with their meeting process, and the quality of the groups' decision products. Empirical investigation provides the following findings: Process facilitation had a positive impact on meeting processes. Content facilitation had a negative impact on meeting processes. The interaction between GSS use and both process and content facilitation had no significant effect on meeting processes. Meeting processes had a strong positive impact on satisfaction, but no impact on product quality.

This paper develops a theoretical model for understanding the effect of Web site design elements on customer loyalty to a Web site. We show the relevance of the business domain of a Web site to gain a contextual understanding of relative importance of Web site design elements. We use a hierarchical linear modeling approach to model multilevel and cross-level interactions that have not been explicitly considered in previous research. By analyzing data on more than 12,000 online customer surveys for 43 Web sites in several business domains, we find that the relative importance of different Web site features (e.g., content, functionality) in affecting customer loyalty to a Web site varies depending on the Web site's domain. For example, we find that the relationship between Web site content and customer loyalty is stronger for information-oriented Web sites than for transaction-oriented Web sites. However, the relationship between functionality and customer loyalty is stronger for transaction-oriented Web sites than for information-oriented Web sites. We also find that government Web sites enjoy greater word-of-mouth effect than commercial Web sites. Finally, transaction-oriented Web sites tend to score higher on mean customer loyalty than do information-oriented Web sites.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,3,97,127

We postulate that as a firm grows larger, a superior IT infrastructure increases the productivity of other inputs by controlling the complexity-related costs that the firm incurs as it increases in size. In the empirical analysis to support this view, we find that firms with high-growth expectations increase their IT spending as their free cash flow increases, whereas low-growth firms maintain a constant level of IT spending, irrespective of their free cash flow. Further, we analyze the effect of IT investments in one period on growth-related metrics in subsequent periods. We find that a superior IT infrastructure significantly reduces the cost of operations for high-growth firms in subsequent periods. In summary, the theory and empirical evidence presented in this paper point to an indirect but important contribution of the IT infrastructure to a firm's growth.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,279,300

Cameron;  Kalyan Moy Gupta,An Empirical Study of Factors Affecting Software Package Selection, human information processing;  information center;  software selection criteria,"Evidence suggests that information centers (ICs) have significantly more interest in evaluating software packages and assisting in the selection of software packages than end users have. However, the selection of software packages by the information center product specialists (ICPSs) can compromise their usage. Ease of use and usefulness are believed to be fundamental predictors of usage. The question of whether ICPSs are able to correctly evaluate ease of use and usefulness of software packages for end users is posed. An insight into this issue could enhance end-user computing (EUC) policy and lead to a more effective partnership between end users and information systems (IS) professionals. A search for this insight provided the motivation for our empirical investigation of the perception of ICPSs and end users in assessing the ease of use and usefulness of thirty different software packages. Our investigation was performed in an organization with an IC that had evolved to the formalization stage. The findings show that the perceptions of the end users and ICPSs were similar in terms of assessing the ease of use of software packages. However, end users found the software packages less useful than did IC product specialists. Therefore, in sophisticated environments, end users should be empowered to develop their own user groups and suggest to IC personnel which useful software packages to acquire. Otherwise, selection of software packages without end-user participation could have an adverse effect on their usage.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,1,89,105

Threats to the database security range from issuing cleverly designed sequences of queries to using such sophisticated methods as regression analysis. In order to overcome this security problem, several solution methods have been suggested in the literature. These methods can be classified under four general approaches: conceptual modeling; query restriction; data perturbation; and output perturbation. These methods, however, can be easily compromised, or require excessive CPU and memory, or result in biased response to users. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new type of output perturbation method that may be very difficult to compromise and provides unbiased response. The method is based on recoiling of the data, the jackknifing concept, and an extension of the random sample queries method suggested by Denning [5]. A comparison of the proposed method and the modified random sample queries method (which is considered a viable alternative for security of statistical databases) is presented.",Journal of Management Information Systems,6,1989,1,101,110

Although electronic trading systems provide potential to create an efficient market structure, we witness that a $45 trillion fixed-income market still makes little use of these systems. Low penetration of electronic trading systems in the marketplace is at odds with the existing information technology research doctrine. The reason is that the creation of efficient market structure through an electronic marketplace is based on macro-level interfirm relationships that do not take into account the recurrent micro-level, interpersonal interaction among the market actors. Our empirical investigation, based on face-to-face interviews with 90 fixed-income senior managers and traders from 25 financial institutions, provides a unique insight into the social capital based on social networks of interpersonal relationships in the fixed-income market. Our research findings show that the market structure of embedded interpersonal ties enables participants to take advantage of information asymmetry for profit taking. As a result, imposition of solely electronic trading systems on the present fixed-income market structure is at odds with the present interfirm market norms and business processes enacted for large transactions among market makers and institutional investors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,233,266

The few studies that have investigated the strategic and economic aspects of SOA are mostly exploratory and lack a more comprehensive framework for understanding the sources of its economic potential. Based on IS and SOA literature, our work goes further in suggesting the SOA economic potential model, which describes the causal relationships between the SOA's style characteristics and value it can provide on the business side. Using this model, we investigate 164 SOA cases published between 2003 and 2008 to explore the economic rationale for adopting SOA. Our findings suggest that SOA's business benefits are currently mainly driven by operational and information technology infrastructural improvements. However, enterprises also realize strategic benefits from SOA; for example, by electronically integrating with their business partners by means of SOA. We use the results of our study to derive propositions and suggest a research model for future studies on SOA's economic potential.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2010,4,145,180

To better understand and evaluate the impact of MIS in organizations, microeconomic production theory is offered as a foundation that relates MIS to decisions and decisions to firm productivity. Based upon analytic and empirical analyses, this production approach is found to be appropriate in more programmed and management or operational control contexts, such as inventory control. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by providing the ability to compare and evaluate alternative MIS as well as to identify optimal MIS configurations. The use of this approach is illustrated in an inventory ordering context.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,1,33,55

Bostrom,The Structuring of Creative Processes using GSS: A Framework for Research, brainstorming;  creativity;  idea generation;  structuration;  group decision support systems,"Radical and discontinuous change is the order of the day in the 1990s. Organizations are seeking to improve their fit with a constantly changing environment through initiatives such as business process redesign (BPR) and total quality management (TQM). Getting people to think creatively is critical to the success of these change efforts. Group Support Systems (GSS) have emerged as a potential means of supporting and augmenting creativity in the modem team-based organization. GSS research, however, has largely ignored the nature (i.e., creativity) of ideas that are generated. This paper seeks to move GSS research on idea generation beyond its previously limited focus on the quantity of ideas generated when using GSS. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and research streams--creativity and idea generation, Kirton's cognitive style, GSS, and adaptive structuration theory (AST)--we distinguish between two orthogonal dimensions for measuring creativity (of ideas, individuals, and creativity processes)--creativity level and paradigm-relatedness, identify and characterize fundamental structuring mechanisms present in creativity techniques and OSS that influence one or the other dimension; and explore the implications of the above for research, design, and the targeted deployment of GSS and creativity techniques in organizations. We develop a theoretical framework of creative processes that is independent of any available or yet unforeseen technologies and techniques. The framework allows researchers and designers to examine OSS and creativity techniques at a finer level of detail than before, thereby allowing a richer understanding of how they work. This improved understanding will help organizations develop and maintain environments that foster creativity in the work force.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,3,87,114

Unfortunately, however, none of the current versions of OOA has included a validation technique tailored to the object-oriented approach. Most, instead, merely recommend document reviews without specifying the kinds of problems to look for. This paper explores the question by applying a natural language parser to a requirements document, extracting candidate objects, methods, and associations, composing them into an object model diagram, and then comparing the results with those determined by manual OOA. To do this, we have adapted an automated natural language parser and used it to examine several high-level system descriptions. The results indicate that, with a modest amount of effort, the technique can give valuable feedback to the analyst.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,3,9,19

One of the major reasons attributed to these failures is the inability to harmonize values held by a diverse set of participants in an environment that is characterized by uncertainty due to changing requirements. In this paper, we focus on a relational approach to achieve congruence between a project manager and a team member with respect to influence tactics. Constructs of perceptual congruence and communication congruence that reflect a level of agreement and degree of shared understanding between the project manager and team members are described. A congruence model is constructed and tied to an intermediate outcome variable of control loss. One hundred and thirteen dyadic pairs of project managers and team members are surveyed in order to test the model. The results indicate that having strong relational equity and common understanding can minimize control loss. It is important to consider the perspectives of both the project manager and a team member while formulating and assessing monitoring strategies to promote the success of an ISD project. Especially, encouraging team members to discuss disagreements constructively can motivate them to perform better and keep things under control. Finally, it is critical to address the performance problems as they occur rather than wait until the completion of the project.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,191,226

The goal of this study was to examine how software development concept thinking changes as individuals shift their mind-set to the object-oriented software development approach. The results indicate that the transition may not be as simple as a single ""aha!"" moment, but rather a series of cognitive shifts as constructs from the old mind-set are replaced by constructs in the new mind-set. In addition, this study identifies problems that may be encountered during the transition due to a lack of cognitive fit, confusion, and reverting to an inappropriate mind-set. The findings from this study may be used to decrease the learning curve and minimize the number of cognitive shifts experienced during the transition.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2009,4,271,297

Although the satisfaction and usage constructs have been well studied in the information systems literature, there has been only limited attention to information and system quality over the past decade. To address this shortcoming, we developed a model consisting of nine fundamental determinants of quality in an information technology context, four under the rubric of information quality (the output of an information system) and five that describe system quality (the information processing system required to produce the output). We then empirically examined the aptness of our model using a sample of 465 data warehouse users from seven different organizations that employed report-based, query-based, and analytical business intelligence tools. The results suggest that our determinants are indeed predictive of overall information and system quality in data warehouse environments, and that our model strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and parsimony. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for both theory and the development and implementation of information technology applications in practice.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2005,4,199,235

To extend transactive memory beyond the scope of small groups, researchers have proposed the use of information technology (IT). This paper provides an integrated discussion of our knowledge from three studies concerning IT support in transactive memory in organizations. Focusing on meta-memory, which is at the heart of transactive memory systems, we examine what meta-memory is maintained by members of transactive memory systems, whether providing this meta-memory in a technology-mediated environment can lead to transactive memory development, whether IT can realistically provide this meta-memory, and whether different requirements exist for different users and in different stages of transactive memory development. We discuss the implications of these studies to both research and practice.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2012,4,69,98

While either assumption can introduce difficulties, generalizing results in one time frame to another time frame may be especially perilous. We study a data exchange, and find that interventions designed to improve exchange features at two points in time have markedly varying effects, from an initial transaction use (time one) to a second transaction occurring two weeks later (time two). Our research objective is to test whether two system design features have the same effects on the intent to continue using an exchange in time two as they had in time one. The two features are control transparency (the availability of information cues) and interim shipping outcome feedback. These effects are mediated, in varying degrees, by perceived information quality. We use social exchange theory and social cognition theory to develop hypotheses regarding changes between time one (the first user transaction) and time two (the second transaction). These are tested using a combined experiment and survey. Supporting the theory, outcome feedback matters at time two even though it did not matter at time one. While control transparency has direct effects on a user's intent to continue use of the exchange in time one, its effects are reduced in time two if negative outcome feedback is communicated to the user. Outcome feedback's effects grow stronger from time one to time two vis-Ã -vis control transparency's effects. This underscores how critical it is to examine such phenomena at more than one period of time. The study also suggests different strategies for managing data exchanges based on the time frame of use. At the initial transaction use, the exchange should make transparent high-quality information cues to its user. At the next transaction, it should provide feedback showing properly fulfilled orders. These findings have implications for both future research examining effective data exchange design and for professionals who wish to enrich electronic data exchange interactions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,269,304

The structural contingency perspective suggests that the fit between coordination and requirements uncertainty influences performance, where fit is conceptualized in three ways: mediation, interaction, and profile deviation. The risk-based perspective suggests that performance risk is an alternative mechanism that explains the effect of coordination and uncertainty on process control and product flexibility. A survey methodology based on sixty-four projects from banking and other industries was used to test the two perspectives and their relevant hypotheses. The results suggest lack of support for any of the three approaches to the structural contingency perspective, but some support for the role of software performance risk in explaining performance. In particular, software performance risk seems to mediate the effect of vertical coordination and requirements uncertainty on process control. Horizontal coordination appears to have a direct and unmediated positive effect on product flexibility but is unrelated to either software performance risk or process control. The findings suggest that practitioners could benefit from awareness of the different capabilities provided by the two coordination mechanisms: Vertical coordination enables project managers to bring projects to closure by reducing performance risks and increasing control over the process, whereas horizontal coordination leads to flexible software applications because it allows exploration of ideas and issues.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,2,77,113

To this end, we highlight the situated organizational learning perspective that views knowledge as embedded in individuals, in connections between individuals, and in artifacts as a useful lens to examine phenomena related to the establishment of KM initiatives. In an ethnographic case study of an effort to change knowledge-work processes in a market research firm, we apply the situated knowledge perspective to highlight the factors responsible for the limited success of the initiative in the firm.

Subramani,The Matrix of Control: Combining Process and Structure Approaches to Managing Software Development, decentralization;  organizational control;  process performance;  software development;  software project management;  standardization,"The performance of firms in the software industry depends considerably on the quality of their software development processes. Managing software development is a challenging task, as management controls needs to impose discipline and coordinate action to ensure goals are met while simultaneously incorporating autonomy to motivate software developers to be innovative and produce quality work. How should such firms manage software development projects so that their development processes are flexible and predictable--resulting in products that meet quality goals and that are delivered within budget and on time? The management literature suggests two approaches to control: the process approach and the structure approach. The process approach recommends control of activities through specifying methods (behavior control) and through specifying performance criteria (outcome control). In contrast, the structure approach recommends control through centrally devised standards for activities (standardization) and by the delegation of authority for decision-making (decentralization). This study synthesizes these two approaches to suggest that formal managerial control is exerted through a matrix of control comprising four modes: standardization of methods, standardization of performance criteria, decentralization of methods, and decentralization of performance criteria. We test the association of the modes of control with performance in a sample of 56 firms in the software industry in the United States. The results suggest that performance is enhanced by establishing uniform performance criteria across projects (standardization of performance criteria) while giving each project team the authority to make decisions with respect to methods (decentralization of methods). However, standardization of methods across all projects and decentralization of performance criteria by delegating the authority to make decisions about performance criteria to project teams were both not...",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,3,159,196

But a central question remains as to the effectiveness of redesign through such knowledge systems. The research described in this paper is focused on testing the effectiveness of knowledge-based, process-redesign systems. We employ one such system, called ""KOPeR-lite,"" as a platform for experimentation to assess the relative efficacy of redesigns generated by computer versus those developed by people. In this sense, we conduct a modified Turing Test to compare redesign performance of reengineering analysts with that of the knowledge system. KOPeR-lite performs comparatively well in certain respects, but human subjects outperform the machine in others. The results provide evidence to support claims of redesign efficacy through knowledge systems, and they offer insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of people and software applications in the reengineering domain. This study further opens up new lines of research and highlights implications for process redesign and practice, including issues associated with leading adoption of knowledge system technology and extension of redesign automation systems such as KOPeR-lite.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,3,25,43

But it is dynamic and distributed unevenly. Capitalizing on this dynamic resource for enterprise performance depends upon its rapid and reliable flows across people, organizations, locations, and times of application. From a technological perspective, this points immediately to the design of information systems to enhance knowledge flows. The problem is, the design of information systems to enhance knowledge flows requires new understanding. The research described in this paper concentrates on understanding the dynamics of knowledge phenomenologically and on developing and applying techniques for modeling and visualizing dynamic knowledge flows and stocks. We draw key, theoretical concepts from multiple literatures, and we build upon integrative modeling work that composes a parsimonious, multidimensional, analytical framework for representing and visualizing dynamic knowledge. We then conduct field research to learn how this theoretical framework may be used to model knowledge flows in practice. By focusing this empirical work on an extreme organization and processes that involve and rely upon tacit knowledge, we illustrate how dynamic knowledge patterns can inform design in new ways. New chunks of kernel theory deriving from this fieldwork are articulated in terms of a propositional model, which provides a basis for the development of testable design theory hypotheses.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,3,225,263

Our experience to date in the use of the idea generation models suggests that the technology does significantly influence the planning process. The automated version of the brainstorming model appears to neutralize many of the group effects that have been responsible for poor performance of group brainstorming in the past. Anonymity is maintained and group members appear to express their true feelings without fear of social disapproval. In addition, the automated idea generation models appear to neutralize the effects of an authority hierarchy in the group. The models allow parallel processing of ideas and prevent one group member from dominating the group discussion. All ideas are automatically recorded in the computer and are stored within the knowledge base for use throughout the planning process. Several factors that inhibit the idea generation process have also been identified. These include the limits imposed on the ""world view"" of the problem as a result of the size of the computer screen, the unfamiliarity of the keyboard interface as a creative tool for executives, and the limitations of the network for processing multiple, simultaneous file transfers. Data indicate that the benefits of the Electronic Brainstorming process definitely outweigh the problems in the view of the planners. They report high levels of satisfaction with the outcome of planning sessions using the models and the process used to achieve those outcomes. They rated the computer as an important tool for idea generation, and those planners who had used a manual brainstorming model in the past rated the computer brainstorming process as ""much better"" than manual brainstorming.

Many organizations have set up Web pages to capture the attention of potential buyers and to develop new business relationships. Others have set up indexing services to provide easy search capabilities to prospective buyers. While the unit search and communication costs have been lowered dramatically by the Internet, the cost of evaluating potential suppliers may still be prohibitive, especially for certain types of products and services. Thus, although the Internet makes it possible to locate a large number of new suppliers, an organizational buyer needs to deploy appropriate supplier-selection strategies (such as sequential evaluation with stopping rules versus bidding systems) that consider all cost elements involved in choosing a vendor. We develop an analytical model that allows a buyer to maximize payoff (net of supplier search, communication, and evaluation costs) from the selection process. We analyze how the nature of the product and the buyer's expectations about supplier characteristics determine whether a sequential evaluation or bidding should be used in the selection process. The Internet, when used in conjunction with the proposed strategies, results in a lower total expected cost to the buyer, even though more suppliers are being evaluated, because a better supplier is selected. We describe how intelligent database searching can further increase the efficiency of the proposed selection strategies. We also develop a minimum requirements announcement mechanism, which makes supplier selection through a bidding strategy economically feasible in situations where legal restrictions may bar the use of sequential evaluation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1997,4,117,137

In this paper, we describe the system and propose a unique class of intelligent agents, which are described as Special Purpose Embodied Conversational Intelligence with Environmental Sensors(SPECIES). SPECIES agents use heterogeneous sensors to detect human physiology and behavior during interactions, and they affect their environment by influencing human behavior using various embodied states (i.e., gender and demeanor), messages, and recommendations. Based on the SPECIES paradigm, we present three studies that evaluate different portions of the model, and these studies are used as foundational research for the development of the automated kiosk. The first study evaluates human-computer interaction and how SPECIES agents can change perceptions of information systems by varying appearance and demeanor. Instantiations that had the agents embodied as males were perceived as more powerful, while female embodied agents were perceived as more likable. Similarly, smiling agents were perceived as more likable than neutral demeanor agents. The second study demonstrated that a single sensor measuring vocal pitch provides SPECIES with environmental awareness of human stress and deception. The final study ties the first two studies together and demonstrates an avatar-based kiosk that asks questions and measures the response using vocalic measurements.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,17,48

The ICE/C system has been developed using Expert System Environment/Virtual Machine (ESE/VM) on the IBM 4381 mainframe. The system is operational and is being tested in five different ICs. ICE/C is used for consultation with IC users to assist them with the process of software selection. The paper presents the ICE/C architecture and discusses functional extensions to ICE/C, that is, ICE/D and ICE/H, for supporting the other responsibilities of the IC.

Teams of graduate students determined the requirements for an automated post office as a course assignment over a period of two weeks.

This 2 x 2 experiment is the first to look at the joint effects of a distributed asynchronous computer conferencing mode of communication (CC, as compared with face-to-face), and a structured process, on software design outcomes. Subjects were teams of graduate students in computer science and business, who designed an automated post office as a course assignment. The quality of solution produced by the CC groups was judged to be marginally higher, while CC groups were rated as considerably more creative. There were no main effects for the structured/unstructured factor, or any significant interactions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,3,127,153
1031, Daniel E. O'Leary,The Impact of Data Accuracy on System Learning, artificial intelligence;  decision support systems;  expert systems;  machine learning,"The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of database accuracy on system learning. The paper assumes a basic model of an information system with a database, a rulebase, and an embedded machine learning approach that is used to add rules to the rulebase. The system learns from its database, changes to that database, and the examination of other databases. The results in this paper can be of use in the analysis of the design and behavior of such learning systems. It is found that the information system accuracy impacts the magnitude of a measure of goodness of individual roles. Thus, if only rules of a certain magnitude are kept, then some rules will be discarded because of database inaccuracy, unless that inaccuracy is accounted for. In addition, by accounting for database inaccuracy, the direction of the impact on measure of goodness can be determined. In some cases, the impact on the direction is monotonic. This finding allows us to understand the impact of database inaccuracy, without explicitly taking account of that inaccuracy. Further, information system accuracy can impact the resulting order of importance of rules, within a set of rules. Since only those higher-ranked rules are kept, database accuracy and measure of goodness can impact what rules are retained in the rulebase of the system. As a result, it is important to account for the information system accuracy in learning information systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1993,4,83,101

A manager's knowledge of technologies, applications, systems development, and management of IT form his or her explicit IT knowledge. This domain further extends to include knowing who knows what, which enables the manager to leverage the knowledge of others. Tacit IT knowledge is conceptualized as a combination of experience and cognition. Experience relates to personal computing, IT projects, and overall management of IT. Cognition refers to two mental models: the manager's process view and his or her vision for the role of IT. The outcomes expected from IT-competent business managers are chiefly two behaviors: an increased willingness to form partnerships with IT people and an increased propensity to lead and participate in IT projects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2001,4,159,182

Such a simplified analytical model provides an effective methodology to describe and quantify the impact of information technology on organizational structures and processes. The model explains and quantifies a variety of organizational issues such as: the significance of hierarchical structures in organizations, the need for business process reengineering after the introduction of information technology, and the exact conditions under which information technology may (and should) lead to more or less centralized structures. Reoptimization of business processes after the introduction of information technology is formulated as a dynamic programming problem.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,1,187,212

Data from a field study in a large emergency room illustrate how doctors, nurses, and clerical staff routinely combine document genres not only in sequences but also in various accumulations achieved through proximity and movement. The combinations of genres add flexibility to the emergency room staff's genre use and allow them to employ individual genres for several purposes. The data allow us to explore how organizational members manage the tension between a need for continuity in communicative practices and a need for flexibility in managing a jumble of paper-based and digital information systems. In addition, it demonstrates how end users often tinker with genres' media and form in the process of altering combinations among specific genres.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2007,4,81,108

Given the limitations of financial and decision theory perspectives on risk, we adopt the strategic management perspective that stresses downside risk as an important alternative measure of firm performance. We examine whether different types of IT investments have a differential impact on firm downside risk. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm and the real options perspective, we find evidence that IT investments and their timing influence organizational downside risk. Transformational and informational IT investments lead to a reduction in downside risk only if they lead to strategic IT investments in the industry. For competitive necessities such as IT investments that automate business functions, a reduction in downside risk is realized by investing in parity with industry participants. Our study contributes to the literature by offering an alternative perspective on the benefits of IT investments, particularly where no apparent incremental financial results may be evident. It also generates insights on IT investment strategies that may help firms keep up with or stay ahead of the competition.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,159,194

We characterize the signaling equilibria where certification of quality conveys information about organizational effectiveness in generating socially valuable services. Interestingly, the emergence of the D2N marketplace may lead to a drop in total net fund-raising revenues in the market, despite the fact that the intermediary's database service eliminates search costs for some donors. We also explain why such a marketplace may deliberately lower the accuracy of its certification process.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,213,242

Spreadsheet development, which has about the error rate as program development, also needs to be followed by an extensive testing phase if spreadsheets are to be reliable. In this study, sixty undergraduate MIS students code-inspected a spreadsheet seeded with eight errors. They first inspected the spreadsheet working alone. They then met in twenty groups of three to reinspect the spreadsheet together. Effort was made to prevent hasty inspection. Individual code inspection, consistent with past studies of both spreadsheet and program code inspection, caught only 63 percent of the errors. Group inspection raised this to 83 percent. However, the group phase never found new errors; it merely pooled the errors found during the individual phase by the three members. One group even ""lost"" an error found during the individual phase. This raises the question of whether a group code inspection phase is really necessary. Other findings were that subjects were overconfident when inspecting alone, that certain types of errors are especially difficult to detect, and that the benefits of the group phase is greatest for these difficult-to-detect types of errors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,2,159,176

This knowledge must be acquired from ""expert"" managers and stored in the system's knowledge base. Unfortunately even experienced managers may be biased in their beliefs about cause-effect relationships. We present a system which uses causal modeling, path analysis, and an historical database to statistically verify asserted relationships as they are entered into the system. Since it is possible that a valid assertion is not statistically supported, the user has the option to insert a relationship into the knowledge base even though the analysis may not indicate statistical validity. Information on rejected relationships is maintained in a ""rejection base"" which is used later to retest assertions whose validity may have changed due to updates to the database. The intent is to provide a system which helps the user learn, in an unbiased manner, about the true nature of causal relationships in the problem domain.",Journal of Management Information Systems,3,1986,1,52,64

Local schemas are argued to be important in verifying conceptual data requirements before proceeding to database design. View integration is claimed to fulfill two purposes: First, a global conceptual schema is a prerequisite to logical design and implementation. Second, global schemas are thought to be useful in improving organizational communication among diverse user groups with different perspectives and information needs. However, performing view integration is difficult. Moreover, there is no empirical evidence that global schemas either impede local verification or support communication. Drawing on classification research, this paper develops and tests claims about the impact of schema structure (local versus global) on verification and communication. Local schemas are hypothesized to better support verification than global schemas. When different local views contain conflicting structure, local schemas are expected to be superior in supporting communication. However, when local views contain complementary structure, global schemas are expected to be superior in supporting communication. A laboratory experiment was conducted to test these predictions. The results support the hypotheses. Implications for the practice of database design and for further research are considered.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,155,183

Prominent examples of these services are online recommender systems and consumer feedback mechanisms, both of which serve to reduce consumer search costs and uncertainty associated with the purchase of unfamiliar products. The central question we address is how recommender systems affect sales. We take into consideration the interaction among recommendations, sales, and price. We then develop a robust empirical model that incorporates the indirect effect of recommendations on sales through retailer pricing, potential simultaneity between sales and recommendations, and a comprehensive measure of the strength of recommendations. Applying the model to a panel data set collected from two online retailers, we found that the strength of recommendations has a positive effect on sales. Moreover, this effect is moderated by the recency effect, where more recently released recommended items positively affect the cross-selling efforts of sellers. We also show that recommender systems help to reinforce the long-tail phenomenon of electronic commerce, and obscure recommendations positively affect cross-selling. We also found a positive effect of recommendations on prices. These results suggest that recommendations not only improve sales but they also provide added flexibility to retailers to adjust their prices. A comparative analysis reveals that recommendations have a higher effect on sales than does consumer feedback. Our empirical results show that providing value-added services, such as digital word of mouth and recommendations, allows retailers to charge higher prices while at the same time increasing demand by providing more information regarding the quality and match of products.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,159,188

In order to integrate and realize performance gains from participating in cooperative supply networks, the importance of information sharing across the supply chain has been emphasized in different literature streams. In this study, we examine the relational antecedents of this critical aspect of supply chain integration--that is, information flow integration. Our objective is to investigate the relationship between relational orientation of the focal firm, as characterized by (1) long-term orientation of its supply chain relationships. (2) asset specificity, and (3) interaction routines and the information flow integration between a firm and its supply chain partners. A research model was developed and data were collected from 110 supply chain and logistics managers in manufacturing and retail organizations. Our results suggest that tangible and intangible resources invested in supply chain relationships enable the integration of information flows with supply chain partners. Specifically, formal and informal interaction routines that take time and effort to develop enable integration of informational flows across a firm's supply chain. Investments in relation specific assets and long-term orientation in relationships enable the development of these interaction routines.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,1,13,49

However, there is no popular method that uses the relational concepts directly, that is, without an intermediate representation such as ER. Mathematically rigorous approaches using decomposition or synthesis do not seem to have been adopted by designers.

Collaborative conflict management style was positively related to performance, group diversity was found to have a moderating influence between collaborative style and group performance, and collaborative style was influenced by the individualistic-collectivistic orientations. Consistent with prior research, we found that collectivistic orientations help enhance the level of collaborative conflict management style prevailing in teams.

The data showed very clearly that the leaders considered it essential to build some level of personal relationship with their virtual team members before commencing a virtual working relationship. A unifying framework of three interrelated theoretical steps, which illustrates how a virtual leader builds relationships with virtual team members, is introduced. These three steps are assessing conditions, targeting level of relationship, and creating strategies.

This paper details the development and empirical validation of a model of software piracy by individuals in the workplace. The model was developed from the results of prior research into software piracy, and the reference disciplines of the theory of planned behavior, expected utility theory, and deterrence theory. A survey of 201 respondents was used to test the model. The results indicate that individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant precursors to the intention to illegally copy software. In addition, punishment severity, punishment certainty, and software cost have direct effects on the individual's attitude toward software piracy, whereas punishment certainty has a significant effect on perceived behavioral control. Consequently, strategies to reduce software piracy should focus on these factors. The results add to a growing stream of information systems research into illegal software copying behavior and have significant implications for organizations and industry groups aiming to reduce software piracy.

Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,45,77

This study uses an experimental survey to test a model that includes a number of factors such as trust mechanisms, ""system trust,"" and vendor reputation. The results suggest that one trust mechanism, vendor guarantees, has a direct influence on system trust. Further, within e-commerce situations, system trust plays an important role in the nomological network by directly affecting trust in vendors and indirectly affecting attitudes and intentions to purchase. These results held in the case of both firms with and without an established reputation. The results demonstrate the importance of interventions such as self-reported vendor guarantees that affect system trust in enabling successful e-commerce outcomes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,3,197,226

McLean,Information Systems Success: The Quest for the Independent Variables, independent variables;  information system success;  research integration;  success determinants;  success factors,"In 1992, DeLone and McLean suggested that the dependent variable for information systems (IS) research is IS Success. Their research resulted in the widely cited DeLone and McLean (D&M;) IS Success Model, in which System Quality, Information Quality, Use, User Satisfaction, Individual Impact, and Organizational Impact are distinct, but related dimensions of IS success. Since the original IS Success Model was published, research has developed a better understanding of IS success. Meanwhile, comprehensive and integrative research on the variables that influence IS success has been lacking. Therefore, we examine the literature on the independent variables that affect IS success. After examining over 600 articles, we focused our attention on integrating the findings of over 140 studies. In this research, we identify 43 specific variables posited to influence the different dimensions of IS success, and we organize these success factors into five categories based on the Leavitt Diamond of Organizational Change: task characteristics, user characteristics, social characteristics, project characteristics, and organizational characteristics. Next, we identify 15 success factors that have consistently been found to influence IS success: Enjoyment, Trust, User Expectations, Extrinsic Motivation, IT Infrastructure, Task Compatibility, Task Difficulty, Attitudes Toward Technology, Organizational Role, User Involvement, Relationship with Developers, Domain Expert Knowledge, Management Support, Management Processes, and Organizational Competence. Finally, we highlight gaps in our knowledge of success factors and propose a road map for future research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,7,62

The conceptual model and conjectures are developed inductively based on logic and prior research about the relationship among variables related to the factors. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to operationalize and test the model. The SEM analysis tests five points of investigation on a large sample of country data from the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Findings indicate a critical pathway of associations between the factors of government support and openness, investment in business and technology, socioeconomic level, and technology utilization. The paper presents two country case examples of the model and suggests policy steps for national governments of developed and developing countries to prioritize information and communications technology, create openness, strengthen research and development and technology investment, and enhance education and information technology training.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,49,83

Information networks can gather thousands of vendors and millions of customers into an information-rich marketplace that serves both their perspectives. Unfortunately, existing electronic shopping systems provide a vendor/customer dialectic that offers low product differentiation and comparability. This limits market efficiency and results in negative experiences for both vendors and customers. We propose a functional architecture for a new generation of electronic shopping infrastructures to dramatically improve vendor representation and customer navigation. This design reshapes the vendor/customer dialectic by providing higher levels of both product differentiation and comparability.

Most proposals, while based on concepts originally developed by economists, are based on the assumption that participants provide truthful information. Over the past twenty years, researchers in economics have explored truth-revealing mechanisms. We apply these ideas to charging for computing resources within an organization. The resulting mechanism provides an incentive for users to tell the system administrator their true valuation of a given configuration. Applications of this mechanism to both long-term and short-term situations are outlined. The long-term situation demonstrates how an appropriate computer configuration can be derived from information obtained from its future users. The short-term situation involves setting priorities among jobs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,6,1989,1,87,100

In this paper we discuss a technology called ASCEND (Advanced System for Computations in Engineering Design), which addresses this issue. We describe two aspects of the technology: a modeling language and an interactive model-building environment. The ASCEND language is structured, declarative and strongly typed, and incorporates object-oriented extensions. The interactive environment is based on the notion of a concurrent set of tools that reflect the various phases of ASCEND modeling. These tools do not enforce a strict sequence of operations, but rather have been designed to support the flexible access implied by declaratively specified models. We claim that ASCEND offers solutions to several of the issues raised by Arthur Geoffrion in his article, ""Computer-based modeling environments,"" [21] and use categories introduced by him to frame this discussion.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,3,91,121

It is expected to reduce fear of social disapproval and of evaluation, and to lower inhibition and censorship. This is believed to create an environment that improves participation and communication, that promotes more objective and honest evaluation of ideas, and that enhances the productivity of groups and their decision-making process. However, empirical evidence about what are the effects of anonymity in GSS is inconclusive. This paper argues that there are two main reasons for the lack of consistent findings. First is the fact that anonymity has been defined too narrowly as the nonidentification of participants when, in fact, the literature in social psychology suggests that anonymity is multidimensional and subjective in nature. Second is the fact that the effects of anonymity interacts with other situational variables, making its relation to disinhibition complex. This paper argues that one critical situational variable is the importance of social evaluation of group members. A measure of the new conceptualization of anonymity and of the importance of social evaluation is proposed and the results of a preliminary test are presented. A contingency approach for studying the effects of anonymity is presented and the implications for future research and for practice are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,3,89,108

It has been applied for several years and it has precise procedures which, when followed closely, yield valid and easily interpretable data. Our assessment of the use of survey research in the MIS field between 1980 and 1990 indicates that this perception is at odds with reality. Our analysis indicates that survey methodology is often misapplied and is plagued by five important weaknesses: (1) single-method designs where multiple methods are needed, (2) unsystematic and often inadequate sampling procedures, (3) low response rates, (4) weak linkages between units of analysis and respondents, and (5) overreliance on cross-sectional surveys where longitudinal surveys are really needed. Our assessment also shows that the quality of survey research varies considerably among studies of different purposes: explanatory studies are of good quality overall, exploratory and descriptive studies are of moderate to poor quality. This article presents a general framework for classifying and examining survey research and uses this framework to analyze the usage of survey research conducted in the past decade in the MIS field. In an effort to improve the quality of survey research, this article makes specific recommendations that directly address the major problems highlighted in the review.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,2,75,105

The research presented here examines one such cognitive activity: analysts' determination of the sufficiency of information gathered during the elicitation of requirements. Research in behavioral decision-making has identified various heuristics, or stopping rules, that are used to gauge the sufficiency of the information obtained and to terminate information acquisition. Despite the fact that analysts undoubtedly employ such stopping rules in requirements elicitation, no research has studied this phenomenon. In the present research, we present a classification of stopping rules appropriate for information gathering problems. Stopping-rule use was identified for 54 practicing systems analysts participating in a requirements determination problem in a laboratory setting. Results indicated that analyst experience influences the application of specific cognitive stopping rules, and that the use of these stopping rules has an impact on requirements determination outcomes. In addition, the use of certain stopping rules resulted in greater quantity and completeness of requirements elicited from users. Theoretical implications for the elicitation of information and practical implications for the training of systems analysts are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,1,203,226

The context is mass and targeted attacks, taking account of strategic interactions between end users and attackers. For both mass and targeted attacks, facilitating end-user precautions reduces the expected loss of end users. However, the impact of enforcement on expected loss depends on the balance between deterrence and slackening of end-user precautions. Facilitating end-user precautions is more effective than enforcement against attackers when the cost of precautions and the cost of attacks are lower. With targeted attacks, facilitating end-user precautions is more effective for users with relatively high valuation of information security, while enforcement against attackers is more effective for users with relatively low valuation of security.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,97,121

The empirical research was done at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), based on several interviews and survey data from 159 individuals across 8 subunits.

If so, what explains the extra value derived from a firm-sponsored virtual community and how might this understanding inform managers about appropriate strategies for leveraging virtual communities as part of a value-creating strategy for the firm? We test two models of virtual community to help shed light on the answers to these questions. We hypothesize that in customer-initiated virtual communities, three attributes of member-generated information (MGI) drive value, while in firm-sponsored virtual communities, a sponsoring firm's efforts, as well as MGI, drive value. Drawing on information search and processing theories, and developing new measures of three attributes of MGI (consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness), we surveyed 465 consumers across numerous communities. We find that value can emerge via both models, but that in a firm-sponsored model, a sponsor's efforts are more powerful than MGI and have a positive, direct effect on the trust-building process. Our results suggest a continuum of value creation whereby firms extract greater value as they migrate toward the firm-sponsored model.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,1,261,292

Strategic benefits are more difficult to evaluate, since they involve dynamic interactions between customers, suppliers, and rivals. In an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, there is a strong incentive to be the first implementor of new technology. However, information technology (IT) costs decline overtime, so there is an incentive to delay implementation. A model is developed that enables managers to evaluate this trade-off and choose the best implementation time. The model emphasizes competition between large firms in a regional (or national) market, interacting with firms in a local market. The model is illustrated with an application to the banking industry. It compares the implementation times of larger regional banks vis-Ã -vis smaller local banks, and shows how the banks might use technology to respond to various changes in the banking industry.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,2,161,187

Linguini is a vectorspace-based categorizer tailored for high-precision language identification. This paper determines the functional dependencies of Linguini's performance and demonstrates that it can identify the language of documents as short as 5 to 10 percent of the size of average Web documents with 100 percent accuracy. It also describes how to determine if a document is in two or more languages, without incurring any appreciable extra computational overhead. This approach can be applied equally to subject-categorization systems to distinguish between cases where, when the system recommends two or more categories, the document belongs strongly to all or really to none.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,3,71,101

The electronic exchange of transaction documents has had a significant impact on business practices, particularly in the sales and purchase/merchandising functions of organizations. EDT brings in many benefits to the organization such as reduced costs, faster turnaround, better customer service, and in some firms strategic advantage over their competitors. Despite these benefits, firms still have problems in implementing EDI. This study, drawing upon research in innovation theory and information systems, examines the relationship between various innovation characteristics (complexity, two forms of compatibility, costs, relative advantage, and communicability) and various attributes of diffusion (adaptation, internal diffusion, external diffusion, and implementation success) of EDT in organizations. The data for the study were collected from a large-scale field survey of 201 firms in the United States that have implemented EDI. Two senior executives, one from information systems (IS) and the other from the sales/purchase function, provided matched responses to a questionnaire that measured the various research constructs. The results of the multivariate regression analyses revealed that relative advantage, costs, and technical compatibility were the major predictors of adaptation. While relative advantage and duration were important predictors of internal diffusion, technical compatibility and duration were found to be important predictors of external diffusion.

Often, a dispersed set of users, with varying demands, requires ongoing access to this content. Effective placement of the multimedia content at different locations/processors thus becomes essential to ensure acceptable quality of service at a reasonable cost. Achieving this requires the consideration of a set of issues quite different from that required for traditional data distribution. These include (a) scale, both in terms of individual objects and in aggregate, (b) importance of form or appearance, making resolution levels an important, controllable variable, and (c) the temporal dimension, placing stringent demands on response time. These concerns make distribution of multimedia content more than a straightforward extension of traditional distribution approaches. The authors develop a model and a supporting approach to facilitate effective distribution of multimedia content, focusing on multimedia applications in corporate intranets. The model consists of multiple criteria to reflect different aspects of quality of service and cost which they formulate by leveraging variance in resolution levels to capture trade-offs among these criteria. Since the multiple-criteria allocation model is NP-complete, they propose a decision support approach that generates locally efficient solutions using designer-specified targets and evaluates them using fuzzy-set-based heuristics. The complete model and the approach have been implemented in a prototype to ensure feasibility. The authors demonstrate use of the prototype for a medical imaging application that illustrates applicability and usefulness of our proposals.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,1,141,165

Early research in this area has focused on object-clustering schemes for shared memory configurations that have limited value to business applications, which must be distributed over loosely coupled networks. These applications also exhibit the properties of simpler structural relationships and a large number of instances, demanding approaches closer to fragmentation and allocation instead of clustering. This paper develops an approach to distribution of object-oriented applications over geographically dispersed sites in loosely coupled networks---taking account of concerns such as encapsulation, inheritance, messaging, and implicit joins. The approach consists of two phases. First, we develop a scheme for generating class fragments, which ensures that encapsulation is not violated and inheritance is not stretched across sites. Second, considering the message-intensive operation of object-oriented systems, we devise models for allocation of class fragments to sites that minimize inter-site traffic. A nonarbitrary procedure to compile traffic volume estimates exploiting the notion of implicit joins in object-oriented applications provides the natural linkage between the two phases. A research prototype was implemented to establish feasibility of the proposals. We demonstrate usefulness of the approach by its application for distribution of a real-world information system.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,195,234

Developed on open standards, Web services have become a promising solution to inter- and intra-organization application integration. The supply chain of Web services exhibits two distinct features that are not considered in previous literature on information and physical-good supply chain: the integration of multiple Web services and the cross-network externality effect between Web service vendors and users. In a quest to fill in the research gap, this paper studies the optimal pricing strategies of a monopolistic intermediary in the supply chain of complementary Web services. The Web service intermediary (WSI) provides both technical and aggregation services, and seeks to charge optimal subscription and listing fees. Analytical results show that in a supply chain of complementary Web services exhibiting cross-network effects, the optimal strategy for the WSI is to set the listing fee such that all service providers list on it. On the other hand, the optimal subscription fee depends on the intensity of the cross-network effect, consumers' valuation of value-added services, and the characteristics of the Web services under consideration.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,3,275,307

Software development could be modeled as an economic production process, therefore the authors propose a theoretical approach to software cost modeling.

The MSCM model is compared with other widely used software cost models, such as COCOMO and SLIM, on the basis of goodness of fit and quality of estimation using software project data sets available in the literature. Judged by both criteria, the MSCM model is comparable to, if not better than, the SLIM, and significantly better than the rest of the models. In addition, the MSCM model provides some insights about the behavior of software development processes and environment, which could be used to formulate guidelines for better software project management polices and practices.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,1,143,163

However, the literature has mostly focused on the functionality design and utilitarian value of such decision support systems, mostly ignoring the potential social influence they could exert on their users. The objective of this study is to apply a social relationship perspective to the design of interfaces for PRAs. We investigate the effects of applying anthropomorphic interfaces--namely, humanoid embodiment and voice output--on users' perceived social relationship with a technological and software-based artifact designed for electronic commerce contexts. The findings from a laboratory experiment indicate that using humanoid embodiment and human voice--based communication significantly influences users' perceptions of social presence, which in turn enhances users' trusting beliefs, perceptions of enjoyment, and ultimately, their intentions to use the agent as a decision aid.

Drawing upon theories from organization behavior and industrial economics, this study identifies four major industry characteristics (i.e., munificence, dynamism, concentration, and capital intensity) and investigates how each of these factors affects the use of IT outsourcing. Specifically, we postulate that the extent of industry munificence is positively related to the utilization of IT outsourcing. Since timely strategic actions are the crucial aspects of leveraging munificent resources, IT outsourcing, which can be implemented in short periods of time, is considered to be a preferred option in such environments. Furthermore, industry dynamism is also positively associated with IT outsourcing, given that firms in dynamically evolving industries tend to look for flexibility and avoid a large amount of fixed investments (e.g., IT development in-house). In contrast to these hypotheses, we predict that industry concentration is negatively related to IT outsourcing. Firms in concentrated industries are likely to develop their own IT infrastructures, as they are not constrained by institutional pressures or cost-driven strategic actions. Finally, because firms in capital-intensive industries tend to conform to long-standing traditional practices, and do not highly value novel and risky practices, they will be less likely to use IT outsourcing than firms in industries with low capital intensity. The data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis along with Compustat empirically validated all of the proposed hypotheses; however, only marginal support was found for the association between industry concentration and IT outsourcing. Our findings offer business executives and IT service providers strategic and managerial insights into the dynamics and complexities involved in the diverse aspects of industry environments and IT outsourcing decisions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2011,4,99,128

However, few theoretical studies have attempted to explain the contingencies under which IT investments may or may not be valuable to a firm in a competitive market. This research proposes a duopoly competition model to study the impacts of IT investments on firm performance and productivity. We show that the extent to which a profit-maximizing firm benefits from IT investments is a function of, among other things, market sensitivities to the price and quality of the products and services offered by the firm and its competitor. We demonstrate that, under duopolistic competition, the effects of IT investments are not as deterministic as under monopolistic competition. We further show that the effect of IT investments on productivity, in a duopoly market, are contingent on market sensitivities to changes in the price and quality of products and services offered by the firm and its competitor, as well as on fixed and overhead costs being sufficiently large in relation to market size--an important condition in a monopoly market. Especially, the price sensitivity has a positive effect on the impact of IT investments on productivity and quality sensitivity has a negative effect. We submit that firms are better off making efficiency-enhancing IT investments if the market in which they operate is more price sensitive than quality sensitive.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,3,121,158

As IS continues to gain increasing recognition as a key organizational system, a study of the various factors that contribute to its effectiveness should be particularly useful. This research explores the relationship between the reporting level of the senior IS executive and two specific aspects of IS, namely, IS organizational role and IS planning. The analysis is based on the responses of IS executives to a survey instrument. Results support the existence of significant linkages between the rank of the IS executive and the IS aspects addressed in the study.

Consequently, model management system(s) have become a key component of decision support system generators. Model management systems support modelers in various phases of the modeling life cycle including model representation, formulation, selection, integration, and execution. An important phase of the modeling life cycle involves analyzing and explaining the behavior of the formulated model. Such an analysis is necessary to understand the structure and behavior of the model, and to verify the appropriateness of the model to the problem. Traditional computer-based methods of analysis use the model solution as a basis to explain the model structure that caused the solution. This article presents an alternate approach that explains model behavior using the model structure and commonsense mathematical rules. The approach builds upon the qualitative reasoning methodology, developed in the artificial intelligence area to explain the behaviors of physical devices. A benefit of the qualitative reasoning approach is that it may describe the causes of modeling errors in terms of model structure. I also describe an implemented prototype model preprocessor that uses qualitative reasoning to provide qualitative explanations of the model behavior prior to solving the model. While I do not claim the sufficiency of the qualitative reasoning approach to detect and describe all types of modeling behavior, the article presents several examples demonstrating the utility of the approach.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,1,73,100

The editions serve to differentiate among different user segments. Introduction of similar low- and high-end products in other markets has been analyzed using segmentation theory. However, the software market is fundamentally different from other product markets in two respects: (1) Software is characterized by negligible marginal production cost, and (2) the option of offering upgrades also exists. The authors analyze the problem of software introduction using segmentation theory. Their analysis shows that if cannibalization is low, the vendor should introduce the full software as one edition. This result differs from that obtained in prior research, which showed that the seller should introduce two distinct products in such cases. When cannibalization is high, introducing multiple editions simultaneously is optimal under a variety of conditions. The strategy of introducing a high-end edition in the first period followed by the low-end edition in the second period is optimal only when the consumers are extremely impatient and the software is large. A significant result of the authors' analysis is that offering upgrades is clearly superior to other strategies only in a very restricted range of parameters. The analysis also suggests that the vendor's profit is higher when it announces the future strategy. Theoretical results are supported by evidence from the software market.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,1,87,113

Multiattribute auctions, which allow bids on multiple dimensions of the product and not just price, are information technology-enabled sourcing mechanisms that can increase the efficiency of procurement for configurable goods and services compared to price-only auctions. Given the strategic nature of procurement auctions, the amount of information concerning the buyer's preferences that is disclosed to the suppliers has implications on the profits of the buyer and the suppliers and, consequently, on the long-term relationship between them. This study explores novel feedback schemes for multisourcing multiattribute auctions that require limited exchange of strategic information between the buyer and the suppliers. To study the impact of feedback on the outcomes and dynamics of the auctions, we conduct laboratory experiments wherein we analyze bidder behavior and economic outcomes under three different treatment conditions with different types of information feedback. Our results indicate that, in contrast to winner-take-all multiattribute auctions, multisourcing multiattribute auctions, with potentially multiple winners, allow bidders (i.e., suppliers) to extract more profit when greater transparency in terms of provisional allocations and prices is provided. We develop several insights for mechanism designers toward developing sustainable procurement auctions that efficiently allocate multiple units of an asset with multiple negotiable attributes among multiple suppliers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2012,4,199,230

This study reviews data collected from 310 manufacturing firms in Israel and 197 such firms in the U.S. For each firm, data were obtained about the benefits derived from using information systems, as perceived by a senior manager, and the organization's operating characteristics. Data were pooled across both countries. No meaningful relationship was found between the benefit a firm derives from its overall information systems application portfolio and its organizational operating characteristics. However, for two individual applications, the benefit derived is linked significantly to the organization's operating characteristics. Thus the model relating benefits from information systems to the organization's operating environment, first demonstrated by data collected in Israel, is confirmed by the data collected in the U.S. The model applies across both countries, even though there may be differences between the two countries, for example, in culture, size of businesses, and relationship with customers and suppliers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,2000,4,175,194

While both contractual and relational factors explain significant variance in BPO satisfaction, relational factors dominate. By examining interactions between key contractual and relational mechanisms, we found that elements of the two governance approaches operate as substitutes with respect to BPO satisfaction. Specifically, the relational mechanism, trust, was found to substitute for contractually specified activity expectations, goal expectations, and contractual flexibility. Similarly, the relational mechanism, information exchange, was found to substitute for contractually specified activity expectations and goal expectations. Finally, the relational mechanism, conflict resolution, was found to substitute for contractually specified goal expectations.

Some ISDs have reported significant hurdles in propagating CASE usage, while documenting the advantages of the technology. We construct and empirically test a theoretical model to explain CASE adoption behavior. Factors considered include need pull (environmental instability of the ISD and performance gap of the ISD), technology push (internal experimentation and learning from external information sources), and the adoption context (top-management support for the IS function, CASE championship, training availability, and job/role rotation). A national survey of 2,700 ISDs resulted in 405 usable responses for the data analysis. Our analysis suggests a reasonable fit between the model and the data. The results indicate that the need-pull factors do not directly promote CASE adoption behavior. Performance deficit promotes CASE championship behavior while negatively affecting other elements of the adoption context. The instability of ISDs, where the very existence of the ISD may be in question, negatively affects all elements of the adoption context. Learning about CASE from external information sources directly promotes CASE adoption. Both technology push factors positively affect all four elements of the adoption context. Of the contextual elements, CASE training availability, CASE championship, and job/role rotation positively affect CASE adoption behavior. Top management support does not affect CASE adoption behavior, which suggests that such support may be more critical for postadoption stages of the diffusion process.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,2,205,234

The first phase also indicated differences among the constituencies regarding the relative importance of the keys. The second phase of the research surveyed a large sample of EIS professionals to further examine the keys obtained from the interviews.

Recent publicity concerning losses incurred by companies because of problems with their sophisticated information systems has focused attention on the importance of these systems to the organization.

Initially, our clinical research focus was on the development of effective ways for treating chronically ill patients, mostly those suffering from neurological disorders. While we identified the medical benefits of this information technology, there remains a salient strategic question addressing its competitive impact. In this paper, we analyze the impact of introducing telemedicine on the market share of the specialty hospital deploying this technology and on the competing hospitals in the region. Our analytical results prove that, contrary to earlier expectations, the value of telemedicine relative to in-person visits is not always increasing with the distance of the patient from the hospital. This result explains why patients located far from the specialty hospital may not prefer telemedicine care. We prove that telemedicine, unlike numerous other e-commerce applications, does not lead to the ""winner takes all"" phenomenon. We found that the advent of telemedicine changes the competitive equilibrium between specialty hospitals and community hospitals. Both hospital types will significantly benefit from delivering complementary care to chronic patients, rather than continuing to compete with each other.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,2,127,158

The complex and intangible nature of IT services, however, renders this task especially difficult. We use a sample of 85 outsourced software development projects to test for the presence of the ""input bias,"" which is defined as the systematic misuse of nondiagnostic input information in forming managerial judgments of outcomes. The service outcome we examine is process performance. The diagnostic inputs are given by objective performance metrics based on the final cost and duration of completed projects, whereas the nondiagnostic inputs are risk anticipations formed by managers prior to the start of the project. We find strong evidence of the input bias, which leads managers' subjective assessments to diverge considerably from objective outcomes, and that it is moderated by contract type.

Five categories emerged: Education and Training, Internal Procedures, Vendor Support, Consultant Support, and Endurance. Organizations apply Education and Training more extensively than the others. Thus the research contributes to understanding the means by which organizations cope with rapid IT change. The research also found that organizations with a group dedicated to investigating emerging IT cope more extensively, but not more successfully, than do those without one.

Yet doing so is crucial to making good innovation decisions. This paper examines how information systems (IS) executives respond to what has been termed organizing visions for IT, grand ideas for applying IT, the presence of which is typically announced by much ""buzz"" and hyperbole. Developed and promulgated in the wider interorganizational community, organizing visions play a central role in driving the innovation adoption and diffusion process. Familiar and recent examples include electronic commerce, data warehousing, and enterprise systems. A key aspect of an organizing vision is that it has a career. That is, even as it helps shape how IS managers think about the future of application and practice in their field, the organizing vision undertakes its own struggle to achieve ascendancy in the community. The present research explores this struggle, specifically probing how IS executives respond to visions that are in different career stages. Employing field interviews and a survey, the study identifies four dimensions of executive response focusing on a vision's interpretability, plausibility, importance, and discontinuity. Taking a comparative approach, the study offers several grounded conjectures concerning the career dynamics of organizing visions. For the IS executive, the findings help point the way to a more proactive, systematic, and critical stance toward innovations that can place the executive in a better position to make informed adoption decisions.

Each version is manipulated and updated as if it were the ""real"" database; however, only differences between the version and the real database are stored. This paper describes an experiment for measuring the overhead of using IUVs for supporting what-if analysis for a range of typical views and queries. Results indicate that the overhead is minimal for creating what-if scenarios based on views with aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) and on views that are small subsets of the database. These are the classes of views that are more often used in decision making. For views that require retrieval of entire or large portions of the database, the overhead can be high and special data structures may be required.",Journal of Management Information Systems,9,1992,1,185,203

The need to globally control and coordinate the IS management function is often met with resistance from local IS managers, who may perceive corporate standards as intrusive. Resource dependence theory (RDT) argues that control is made easier when a subsidiary unit is dependent on corporate headquarters for critical resources. This study examined the IS management relationship and the use of various mechanisms of control (formal and informal) between 54 headquarters--subsidiary pairs spread across 19 countries of varying resource-richness. While RDT appears to be valid when subsidiaries are dependent on MNC headquarters for resources, the expected relationship between the mechanisms and host country IS resource availability was not observed.

However, these results have been mixed, and scholars have called for examining contingencies under which the effects of different types (related, unrelated, geographic) and levels of diversification on performance vary. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by arguing that examining the performance effects of diversification is incomplete without taking into consideration the firm's information technology (IT) spending. We posit that IT, by enabling coordination and control in firms, is likely to moderate the relationship between diversification and performance. Combining arguments from both resource-based view and the organizational controls literature, we theorize about the moderating effects of IT spending under different types and levels of diversification. Using data from large U.S. manufacturing firms, we test our research hypotheses. Our results indicate that while IT spending interacts with related diversification to have a positive effect on firm performance, similar interactions with unrelated diversification do not have any effects on firm performance. Furthermore, the interaction between IT spending and geographic diversification is positively associated with performance only when the level of geographic diversification is low.

The quality and systems development literatures are synthesized to develop eleven quality management constructs and two quality performance constructs. Scales for these constructs are empirically validated using data collected from a national survey of IS organizations. A LISREL framework is used to test the reliability and validity of the thirteen constructs. The results provide support for the reliability and validity of the constructs. A cluster analysis of the data was conducted to examine patterns of association between quality management practices and quality performance. The results suggest that higher levels of institutionalization of all quality management practices are associated with higher levels of quality performance. The results also suggest that key factors that differentiated high- and low-quality performing IS units include senior management leadership, mechanisms to promote learning and the management infrastructure of the IS unit.

A basic premise is that a firm's performance can be explained by how effective the firm is in using information technology (IT) to support and enhance its core competencies. In contrast to past studies that have implicitly assumed that IS assets could have direct effects on firm performance, this study draws from the resource complementarity arguments and posits that it is the targeted use of IS assets that is likely to be rent-yielding. We develop the theoretical underpinnings of this premise and propose a model that interrelates IS resources. IS capabilities. IT support for core competencies, and firm performance. The model is empirically tested using data collected from 129 firms in the United States. The results provide strong support for the research model and suggest that variation in firm performance is explained by the extent to which IT is used to support and enhance a firm's core competencies. The results also support our proposition that an organization's ability to use IT to support its core competencies is dependent on IS functional capabilities, which, in turn, are dependent on the nature of human, technology, and relationship resources of the IS department.

Reinig,Toward an Understanding of Satisfaction with the Process and Outcomes of Teamwork, collaborative technology;  goal setting theory;  group support systems;  meeting satisfaction;  teams,"Collaborative technologies such as group support systems (GSS) are often developed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teams; however, the satisfaction users have with the processes and outcomes of the teamwork itself often determines the ultimate adoption and sustained use of collaborative technologies. Much of the research on teamwork has focused on meetings in particular and, consequently, satisfaction with the process and outcomes of meetings, referred to collectively as meeting satisfaction. Research on meeting satisfaction in GSS-supported groups has been equivocal, indicating the need for advancement in our theoretical understanding of the construct. To that end, this paper presents a causal model of meeting satisfaction derived from goal setting theory. The model is tested with an empirical study consisting of 15 GSS groups and 11 face-to-face (FTF) groups engaged in the 'lost at sea' task. The results of analysis using structural equation modeling indicate support for the model's integrity across both GSS and FTF groups. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed, including how the model can be used to improve future research on the use of collaborative technology to support teamwork.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2003,4,65,83

In other words, only once a specific isolated option is identified as being embedded in a target IT investment, does this research call upon using real options analysis to evaluate the option. In effect, however, because real options are not inherent in any IT investment, they usually must be planned and intentionally embedded in a target IT investment in order to control various investment-specific risks, just like financial risk management uses carefully chosen options to actively manage investment risks. Moreover, when an IT investment involves multiple risks, there could be numerous ways to reconfigure the investment using different series of cascading (compound) options. In this light, we present an approach for managing IT investment risk that helps to rationally choose which options to deliberately embed in an investment so as to optimally control the balance between risk and reward. We also illustrate how the approach is applied to an IT investment entailing the establishment of an Internet sales channel.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,2,43,84

However, researchers in the field discovered that users sometimes find themselves feeling emotionally unfulfilled despite exceptionally good results: users report a loss of the affective reward often associated with a challenging meeting where they struggle and succeed. This lack of engagement has been shown to be a cause of user resistance to adopting GSS technology. Team effectiveness may be reduced over time as users seek less-effective but more-gratifying alternatives. This paper frames affective reward as a function of excitation transfer. It describes the development and validation of an instrument to measure affective reward, and presents the results of the first laboratory investigation of the construct.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,3,171,185

In this paper, we examine the four measures typically used to evaluate ideation quality, including idea-count, sum-of-quality, average-quality, and good-idea-count, and discuss their validity and potential biases. An experimental study comparing three levels of social comparison was used to illustrate the differences in the ideation quality measures and revealed that research conclusions were dependent on the measure used. Based on our analysis of the measures and experimental results, we recommend that only good-idea-count be used as a measure to evaluate ideation treatments and call into question research that has based its findings on the other measures. Finally, we discuss implications for research and other potential approaches to evaluating ideation quality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2007,4,143,161

However, some instructors are reluctant to adopt GSS because they are concerned that learners will engage in flaming, or verbal attacks intended to offend either persons or organizations and often characterized by profanity, obscenity, and insults. This paper posits that flaming is caused by hostility engendered by a perception that vested interests have been or are about to be violated. It further posits that the relationship between hostility and flaming is moderated by personal values and risk of reprisal.

1125, Bruce A. Reinig;  Bongsik Shin,The Dynamic Effects of Group Support Systems on Group Meetings, adaptive structuration theory;  computer-mediated communication;  group support systems,"A number of theoretical models have been presented in group support systems (GSS) literature, which suggest that various GSS structures such as anonymity and simultaneity, influence group interaction, which in turn influences group productivity and meeting outcomes. Examples of such theories include the adaptive structuration theory and the balance of forces model and they could generally be described as dynamic or procedural in nature. Much of the empirical research that tests such theories, however, is deterministic in that it often compares final outcomes between various levels of technological support without measuring and testing (1) the influence that the technological structures have on group interaction and group dynamics, and (2) the corresponding influence that group interaction has on meeting outcomes. This paper reports a study that examines the validity of such dynamic theories by examining the relationships between GSS structures, group dynamics, and meeting outcomes over time. Four process constructs (production blocking, free riding, sucker effect, and evaluation apprehension) and three meeting outcome constructs (group cohesion, affective reward, and self-reported learning) were initially selected for the study. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze longitudinal survey data gathered from an experiment conducted with naturally occurring groups. The model tested was found to be valid and GSS was found to be effective in reducing process losses. However, the findings also revealed that process losses vary in the degree to which they influence meeting outcomes and certain meeting outcomes, such as affective reward, were found to be heavily influenced by other meeting outcomes, such as group cohesion and self-reported learning. Theoretical implications of the study and methodology are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,2,303,325

High performance requires smooth coordination across multiple groups whose incentives, cultures, and routines can conflict. In this paper, we present an in-depth case study of a hospital's operating room practices to understand challenges associated with multiple group coordination and how information technology may help. We use the concept of trajectory to focus our observations and interviews on workflow across groups and critical events when coordination breaks down. A careful examination of the sources, coping mechanisms, and consequences of coordination breakdowns suggests three factors whose absence may impede effective responses to unexpected interruptions: (1) trajectory awareness of what is going on beyond a person's immediate workspace, (2) information systems integration, and (3) information pooling and learning at the organizational level. We conclude with technological recommendations to promote trajectory awareness and to automate information gathering and monitoring, so as to facilitate multiple group coordination in complex and dynamic task environments.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,1,105,130

Amount and network measures of E-mail usage were significantly associated with work and work familiarity networks, As time passed, interns communicated through E-mail more outside their formal mentor-intern relations. However, amount of E-mail use and most E-mail network measures (such as centrality) were not related to mentors' assessments of interns' performance several months later. An intriguing exception was how interns were located in the overall E-mail network. Surprisingly, overall, most forms of communication were negatively associated with performance ratings. These results imply that it is not necessarily how much one uses an E-mail system, but how the users are positioned in that system's structural context, that may affect R&D; performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,1,9,29

The delivery task is partitioned into two consecutive stages: system design and software development. The parties can contract for each stage separately or specify an initial contract that covers both stages. We compare the impact of different contracting structures on prices, project value, project completion probability, and the value to the developer of obtaining the first stage of the contract. Specifically, we show that a two-stage contracting can lead to a higher business value than stage-by-stage contracting. When there is competition for the design stage, the vendors bear more of the software development risk, and the probability the system will be completed depends on the contract structure.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,1,57,72

Torre,Information Systems for Optimal Transaction Implementation, electronic trading;  fuzzy sets;  preference-based trading;  securities markets,"In a securities market, the initiator of a large transaction can expect the realized price of his or her trade to be inferior to the current market price immediately prior to his appearance in the market. This ""transaction implementation cost"" phenomenon is a major concern of institutional money managers, both in portfolio selection and in trade implementation strategy. A considerable amount of current research in finance theory deals with modeling and prediction of these costs for equities trading, and commercial products and services recently have become available for probabilistically estimating real-time transaction implementation costs versus transaction size on a stock-specific basis. Earlier papers described the concept of satisfaction- or preference-based trading, with optimization of trade matching on the basis of mutual preference. A market structure based on this design began trading listed equities on the Pacific Exchange on January 29, 1999 under the trade name OptiMark Registered Trademark. The Nasdaq market plans to begin trading using the OptiMark system later in 1999, followed by the Osaka Securities Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2000. A prima-facie benefit of this approach is the ability to specify trading strategies that explicitly account for transaction implementation cost estimates as a function of the trade size. In this paper, the authors present the underlying theoretical framework that unites the concepts of preference-based trading and probabilistic transaction cost estimation. In particular, they develop an analytical generalization of the current market structure constructs of market orders and limit orders. They describe a feasible optimization problem whose solution yields optimal preference profiles, given current market conditions (as reflected by the probability distribution of transaction implementation cost) and a trader-specified coefficient of urgency.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,2,47,62

We examine the monopolist's choice of content quality and price for a fee-based site targeted at high-type consumers and the content quality level for a sponsored site offered free to all consumers. We show how a reduction in the potential for advertising revenues results in lower content quality on the free site, but permits the seller to raise the fee charged to high-type consumers. We also show how differences in consumer tolerances to ads affects content quality, banner ad volume, and usage fees. In particular, the seller can increase profits by making ads more attractive to either high- or low-type consumers, but rarely both at the same time. We show the conditions that determine which consumer segment the seller should seek to improve ad relevancy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,69,86

We show how the digital divide, where high-type consumers dominate the online channel and low-type consumers dominate the offline channel, artificially segments the market-place, thereby mitigating the classic cannibalization problem. This allows the seller to more efficiently market its goods to each consumer segment. We show conditions under which low-type consumers are initially served in the offline channel, but subsequently bridging the divide results in their not being served in either channel. We also examine the implications of bridging the digital divide when the seller uses delay by engaging in intertemporal price discrimination.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,2,161,179

This research examines how service-level agreement contract flexibility should be designed when the technological and business market environments result in volatility of demand, based on an understanding of related changes in the cost drivers that underlie IT services contracts. Our approach draws on a blend of well-known methods from financial economics--the real option pricing method and the contingent claims analysis method. In particular, our research examines a setting in which a vendor provides IT services to a client according to a prenegotiated IT services contract in the presence of demand volatility. We analyze the motivation of and value consequences for a vendor that offers the client the flexibility to opt out of the contract. For example, the client might switch to another vendor, or backsource and provide its own services internally. Our core results offer important foundational thinking for how to specify various forms of IT service-related flexibility in terms of put and call options from the point of view of an IT services vendor, so that their value and exercise timing can be estimated. We show that the client firm's demand trigger value for deciding when to backsource its IT services varies, and it depends on the degree of demand volatility as well as the usage-based fees charged by the vendor. Working from our modeling approach, we also are able to characterize the extent to which a vendor can benefit from bearing the costs of making a backsourcing flexibility option available to its client.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2010,4,317,358

The fact that IOS are shared by separate trading partners means that the benefits from IOS are both unequal and interdependent. Therefore, how trading partners implement and use the system internally may directly affect the original firm's benefit. In order to maximize benefits from IOS, we propose that firms engage in business partner reengineering. We study two buyer-initiated EDI systems where the way in which trading partners internally implement the technology directly affects the level of benefit for the initiating buyer. In both cases, the buyer's benefit is increased when suppliers choose to adopt an optional buyer-initiated modification to their system. However, because it is not clear how suppliers benefit from the modification, they may not have adequate incentives to make the modification. Buyers with substantial leverage over their suppliers may require trading partners to implement the system in a particular way or not be considered for future business.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,2,37,57

In this view, trust develops gradually over time based on an individual's cognitive assessment of the other person's behavior. However, high levels of trust have been observed among members of virtual teams, who often have little prior history of working together and may never meet each other in person. To integrate these two seemingly contradictory views of trust, this study manipulated team member characteristics and team member behavior to empirically test a two-stage theoretical model of trust formation and the influence of information and communication technologies (ICT) on trust formation. The results indicate that category-based processing of team member characteristics and an individual's own disposition to trust dominated the initial formation of swift trust. Once individuals accumulated sufficient information to assess a team member's trustworthiness, the effects of swift trust declined and knowledge-based trust formed using team members' behaviors (perceived ability, integrity, and benevolence) became dominant. The use of ICT increased perceived risk of team failure, which reduced the likelihood that team members would engage in future trusting behaviors.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,241,279

Customer agility captures the extent to which a firm is able to sense and respond quickly to customer-based opportunities for innovation and competitive action. Drawing from the dynamic capability and IT business value research streams, we propose that IT plays an important role in facilitating a ""knowledge creating"" synergy derived from the interaction between a firm's Web-based customer infrastructure and its analytical ability. This will enhance the firm's ability to sense customer-based opportunities. IT also plays an important role in ""process enhancing"" synergy obtained from the interaction between a firm's coordination efforts and its level of information systems integration, which facilitates the firm's ability to respond to those opportunities. We also leverage the competitive dynamics and strategic alignment literature to propose that the alignment between customer-sensing capability and customer-responding capability will impact the firm's competitive activity. We test our model with a two-stage research design in which we survey marketing executives of high-tech firms. Our results show that a Web-based customer infrastructure facilitates a firm's customer-sensing capability; furthermore, analytical ability positively moderates this relationship. We also find that internal systems integration positively moderates the relationship between interfunctional coordination and a firm's customer-responding capability. Finally, our results show that agility alignment affects the efficacy of a firm's competitive actions. In particular, action efficacy is higher when sensing and responding capabilities are both high.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2012,4,231,270

The projects included two complex tasks (i.e., LAN and WAN development tasks) and a less complex development task (i.e.. a small business Web site development task). The study found that project complexity can affect the group interaction process. Participants reported significantly higher expectations, group integration, communication, and participation while working on less complex projects. Efforts to organize project personnel and define roles were more effective with less complex projects. Power struggles and noninvolvement remained a problem for teams regardless of project complexity. This study identifies and confirms key problem areas that can lead to project failure as IT projects become more complex. The results should interest both researchers and information systems managers, because the study is among the first to extend the common body of knowledge concerning group interaction and task complexity to IT projects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,223,247

The concept of structural equivalence, operationalized by blockmodeling, was used to measure the effect of the social group on individual information systems usage. The results of the field study show that structural equivalence is related to IS usage, but this relationship is different for different information systems.

It compares firms based on their dialectic learning process. All firms had to overcome knowledge barriers of two types: those associated with the configuration of the ERP package, and those associated with the assimilation of new work processes. We found that both strong core teams and carefully managed consulting relationships addressed configuration knowledge barriers. User training that included both technical and business processes, along with a phased implementation approach, helped firms to overcome assimilation knowledge barriers. However, all firms in this study experienced ongoing concerns with assimilation knowledge barriers, and we observed two different approaches to address them. In a piecemeal approach, firms concentrated on the technology first and deferred consideration of process changes. In a concerted approach, both the technology and process changes were undertaken together. Although most respondents clearly stated a preference for either piecemeal or concerted change, all firms engaged in practices that reflected a combination of these approaches.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,1,17,46

An information systems (IS) methodology to meaningfully analyze this vast resource of QD could provide useful information, knowledge, or wisdom firms could use for a number of purposes including new product development and quality improvement, target marketing, accurate 'user-focused' profiling, and future sales prediction. In this paper, we present an IS methodology for analysis of Internet-based QD consisting of three steps: elicitation, reduction through IS-facilitated selection, coding, and clustering; and visualization to provide at-a-glance understanding. Outcomes include information (relationships), knowledge (patterns), and wisdom (principles) explained through visualizations and drill-down capabilities. First we present the generic methodology and then discuss an example employing it to analyze free-form comments from potential consumers who viewed soon-to-be-released film trailers provided that illustrates how the methodology and tools can provide rich and meaningful affective, cognitive, contextual, and evaluative information, knowledge, and wisdom. The example revealed that qualitative data analysis (QDA) accurately reflected film popularity. A finding is that QDA also provided a predictive measure of relative magnitude of film popularity between the most popular film and the least popular one, based on actual first week box office sales. The methodology and tools used in this preliminary study illustrate that value can be derived from analysis of Internet-based QD and suggest that further research in this area is warranted.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2003,4,213,246

We present a model explaining the enabling effects of GSS and content facilitation on group processes (group participation, quality of feedback, domination, and communication barrier), cooperation in learning, and individual knowledge structures (knowledge complexity, integration, and commonality). An experiment that employed a 2X2 factorial design was used to explore the main and interaction effects of GSS and content facilitation on knowledge acquisition. Experimental subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups; that is, nonfacilitation and non-GSS, nonfacilitation and GSS, facilitation and non-GSS, facilitation and GSS. Results of the experiment indicated that both GSS and content facilitation positively affect certain aspects of individual knowledge acquisition. Content facilitation particularly enhanced learners' knowledge commonality, whereas GSS enhanced the quality of feedback and cooperation in learning, and reduced domination and communication barrier. However, the results also indicated that GSS and content facilitation have crossover interaction effects on group participation and knowledge commonality. The effects of combining GSS and content facilitation were not additive in this study. Explanations are presented.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,185,229

These problems involve alternative investment structures that bear different risk profiles for the firm, and also may improve the payoffs of the associated projects and the organization's performance. We sought to surface the costs, benefits, and risks associated with a complex sequential investment setting that has the key features that OBRiM treats. We combine traditional, purchased real options that subsequently create strategic flexibility for the decision maker, with implicit or embedded real options that are available with no specific investment required provided the decision maker recognizes them. This combination helps the decision maker to both (1) explicitly surface all of his or her strategic choices and (2) accurately value those choices, including ones that require prior enabling investments. The latter permits senior managers to adjust a project's investment trajectory in the face of revealed risk. This normally is important when there are uncertain organizational, technological, competitive, and market conditions. The context of our research is a data mart consolidation project, which was conducted by a major airline firm in association with a data warehousing systems vendor. Field study inquiry and data collection were essential elements in the retrospective analysis of the efficacy of OBRiM as a means to control risk in a large-scale project. We learned that OBRiM's main benefits are (1) the ability to generate meaningful option-bearing investment structures, (2) simplification of the complexities of real options for the business context, (3) accuracy in analyzing the risks of IT investments, and (4) support for more proactive planning. These issues, which we show are more effectively addressed by OBRiM.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,2,103,140

This model unifies several concepts generally considered to be quite distinct. In particular, it minimizes the formal distinction between the users of the database, the programs embedded in it, and even the administrators and the programmers maintaining it. Furthermore, under this model, the concepts of subschema and of program module are replaced with a single concept of frame, which serves as the locus of power and of activity in the system. Moreover, the proposed control mechanism is closed, in the sense that the process of establishing controls is itself controllable by the same mechanism. This can be used to formalize and enforce a variety of managerial policies about the use and evolution of database systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,3,1986,1,5,31

Past research has shown that although some organizations adequately and consistently consider social subsystem issues when making IT investment decisions, many do not. This demonstrates a discrepancy between prescriptive theory and descriptive evidence. Our study addresses this theory-practice disconnection by investigating which firms, and under what conditions IT investments are likely to follow or violate prescriptions. Data collected from a national sample of 200 firms shed light on the firm and situational factors that affect the consideration of social subsystem issues during the IT investment decision process. The amount of social subsystem disruption associated with the IT in question, the strategic relevance of the IT to the organization, and the firm's continuous-learning culture each have direct or interactive influences on the decision process. Specifically, they impact the consideration of social subsystem costs and benefits for IT investments. Organizational size and industry are unrelated to this facet of decision-making. Overall, the empirical results help us better understand (1) what kinds of IT decisions cause stronger evaluation of social subsystem costs and benefits, (2) what types of firms give the greatest consideration to these issues, and (3) which intangible social subsystem costs or benefits are seen as the most important.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,2,85,127

Vepsalainen,Procurement Strategies for Information Systems, contingency approach;  information systems procurement;  outsourcing,"A general framework of different procurement strategies is introduced to help managers review their project portfolio to find more effective ways of using both internal and market resources in information systems development. Major decision criteria-the specificity of system design and the uncertainty involved in requirements specification-are adopted from transaction cost economics to determine what procurement strategies should be used in different situations. According to our Procurement Principle, systems that are company-specific and involve high uncertainty have to be internally developed because they require both the specific knowledge arid intensive interaction between developers and users. More standard requirements indicate the use of outside consultants or software contractors who have experience and knowledge about a similar type of systems. For routine systems common in many organizations, acquisition and tailoring of a software package provides the most efficient procurement strategy. The Procurement Principle is also empirically tested with data from recent system development projects in major Finnish companies. Partial support was gained for the framework, but some interesting deviations were also detected, such as a tendency to rely on in-house development of even routine systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,2,187,208

King,An Empirical Taxonomy of the Decision- Making Processes Concerning Strategic Applications of Information Systems, empirical taxonomy;  information systems planning;  strategic decision making;  strategic information systems,"The strategic potential of information systems (IS) is now well recognized. However, there has been little explicit research on the process through which managers decide to develop IS applications that may provide strategic benefits. Consequently, several divergent views exist about this process, including those that consider it as a planned process, as a process that ignores formal planning methodologies, as a process that takes place incrementally, and as a process that occurs accidentally. This paper addresses this divergence of views by using strategic IS decisions in eighty-one companies to generate an empirical taxonomy including five alternative ways of making strategic IS decisions. The five decision-making processes--namely, planned, provincial, incremental, fluid, and political--seem quite distinct, in terms of the activities involved and the influences encountered, as well as the conditions under which they are used. Thus, the paper suggests to managers deciding on potentially strategic systems that no one process should be considered universally applicable. Instead, any one of five processes comprising the taxonomy may be used, depending on the specific circumstances.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1995,4,177,214

To facilitate understanding of the social and semantic structure of VLSCs, two tools from the social sciences--social networks and semantic networks--have been extended for the purposes of interface design. As interface devices, social and semantic networks need to be flexible, layered representations that are useful as a means for summarizing, exploring, and cross-indexing the large volumes of messages that constitute the archives of VLSCs. This paper discusses the design criteria necessary for transforming these social scientific representations into interface devices.

In an environment that commodities products and allows for easy imitative behavior through instant access to information on competitor's offerings, it is not clear how to build a sustainable competitive advantage. This study endeavors to facilitate an understanding of this complex issue. Electronic commerce competence is posited as a key driver of organizational performance, and it is argued that this effect is mediated by the generation of ""customer value"" through Web site functionality. By empirically analyzing primary and secondary data from over 100 companies, the relationship between electronic commerce competence, customer value, and both short- and long-term firm performance is examined. The results show that firms with high electronic commerce competence exhibit superior performance and that customer value generated through Web site functionality partially mediates this relationship. In addition, the results show that companies can enhance short-term performance by providing value to the customer in prepurchase situations. But in order to build customer loyalty and thus long-term performance, companies need to enhance the product ownership experience of customers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,1,223,256

The empirical evidence, however, does not support this. A review of the literature suggests that one critical weakness in empirical investigations is inadequacy of operational measures of participation to gauge user influence on system design. Furthermore, there is also a growing consensus that the contradictory evidence may be due to a contingent, rather than a direct, relationship between participation and system success. This conception asserts that the outcome of user participation may depend on various contextual variables. One variable in particular--users' system-related functional expertise--is believed to moderate the outcome of participation. This paper derives the contingent effect of user expertise and reports the results of a controlled laboratory experiment and a field survey conducted to test it. The data suggest that users who perceive themselves as functional experts, relative to others, are unlikely to accept a system unless they exerted a substantive influence on its design. On the other hand, users who perceive themselves as functional nonexperts, relative to others, are likely to accept a system regardless of the extent of their influence on its design. This finding suggests user expertise as a useful criterion for selecting participants to serve on design teams and for determining the appropriate extent of a participant user's influence on system design.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,1,145,166

With respect to business reengineering, we address: (1) How can differing needs for process reengineering projects be characterized? (2) To what extent does organizational resistance to reengineering projects differ by categories of need? and (3) To what extent are failure rates experienced by reengineering practitioners traceable to lack of alignment between project needs, planning agendas, and dominant modes of organizational resistance? We develop an explanatory framework based on two constructs, expertise half-life and information half-life, and apply these to help analyze current practices in business reengineering. We posit that under certain conditions high project failure rates are associated with weak coupling between reengineering project objectives and the firm's general business and information systems planning agendas. Under other conditions, this weak coupling is associated with successful projects.

A good example is the application of a heuristic nested variation of the Black-Scholes (BS) model to the evaluation of interrelated IT investments as nested options. This particular heuristic BS model could overvalue by more than 100 percent. Using a binomial model that is custom-tailored to a generic IT investment embedding nested options as the ""baseline,"" we identify conditions under which the degree of overvaluation of this heuristic BS model is severe and unpredictable. Moreover, upon examining the structure of the custom-tailored binomial model, we identify the reason for overvaluation and derive a more accurate nested variation of the BS model. These findings should serve as a cautionary message about the use of untested heuristic ROA models.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,1,239,261

This paper presents the cognitive network model (CNM) as a causal model of the cognitive mechanisms that give rise to creative solutions in the human mind. The model may explain why creativity prescriptions work as they do. The model may also provide a basis for deriving new techniques to further enhance creativity. The paper tests the model in an experiment where 61 four-person groups used either free-brainstorming or one of three variations on directed-brainstorming to generate solutions for one of two unstructured tasks. In both tasks, people using directed-brainstorming produced more solutions with high creativity ratings, produced solutions with higher average creativity ratings, and produced higher concentrations of creative solutions than did people using free-brainstorming. Significant differences in creativity were also found among the three variations on directed-brainstorming.

Hence, during the postimplementation period of a bank's new work flow system, we conducted a longitudinal participant observation study to observe knowledge transfers of users and information technology (IT) professionals assigned to a help desk. We found that although users turned to IT professionals to obtain knowledge related to conceptual understanding and procedures to use the system, they most often turned to other users to obtain knowledge that allowed them to adapt the system to their work. IT professionals, on the other hand, often turned to their colleagues to obtain knowledge that helped them modify the system to emerging innovative uses. These patterns of knowledge transfers can be explained based upon source expertise. Our findings indicate that organizations must sustain designated sources of knowledge such as help desks, but must also establish conduits for users to acquire knowledge from other users and develop innovative uses of the system. A substantial amount of critical knowledge transfers relevant to system adaptation occurred during face-to-face discussions between users and IT professionals, and therefore future research should examine how this would be affected by the outsourcing of technical support functions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,1,171,199

Yet precisely how communication and trust influence certain outcomes within virtual teams remains unresolved. In this study, we seek to contribute some clarity to the understanding of the theoretical linkages among trust, communication, and member performance in virtual teams. To this end, we identify and test three proposed models (additive, interaction, and mediation) describing the role of trust in its relationship with communication to explain performance. In testing the relationships, we note that the concepts of communication and trust are inherently relational and not properties of individuals. Thus, we argue that a social network approach is potentially more appropriate than attribute-based approaches that have been utilized in prior research. Our results indicate that the ""mediating"" model best explains how communication and trust work together to influence performance. Overall, the study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on virtual teams by empirically reconciling conflicting views regarding the interrelationships between key constructs in the literature. Further, the study, through its adoption of the social network analysis approach, provides awareness within the IS research community of the strengths of applying network approaches in examining new organizational forms.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,1,273,309

Specifically, through the use of idea-generation techniques, business owners hope to promote creative idea generation by their employees. Several leading corporations (and, concomitantly, researchers) have become interested in the use of group support systems (GSS) to enhance idea generation. A key component of the GSS-based idea-generation process is group memory, a repository of ideas created by users of GSS. Group memory provides stimuli, in the form of ideas, to the individuals using the software. This study seeks to better understand the manner in which the contents of the group memory influence the type of ideas generated by individuals in the group. The authors report the results of a laboratory experiment that investigated whether the stimuli contained within a GSS group memory (i.e., ideas) systematically influenced the extent of paradigm shift represented in the ideas generated by individuals. A GSS simulator designed for this study was used to allow for the manipulation of the stimuli in the group memory. The results suggest that individuals tend to generate ideas that match the paradigm-relatedness of ideas provided to them as stimulation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1999,4,143,160

Despite these efforts, not much is really known about user-perceived needs for group support. This study surveyed professional employees and managers about their perceived needs for various types of group work support technologies--support for face-to-face meetings, support for electronic meetings, and support for group work between meetings. One hundred and fifty-three respondents in thirty-four organizations assessed the usefulness of the three support scenarios and a variety of associated software tools to one of their specific work groups. Generally, potential users were quite receptive, although a number of respondents were rather skeptical about computer support for meetings. Overall, support for group work between meetings was perceived to be more useful than either support for face-to-face or electronic meetings, and traditional single-user tools were perceived to be more useful than multiuser group tools. Respondent assessments of the usefulness of support scenarios and tools were partially explained by variables such as attitude toward computers, computer usage intensity, attitude toward group work, number of work groups, and time spent in meetings. Variables related to the specific work group described by the respondent also explained differences respondents in a group with multidepartment membership, multilocation membership, larger size, more formal meetings, and higher between-meeting communication intensity perceived computer support to be more useful. Even though the assessments were based on written descriptions, these results indicate that respondents generally understood the support scenarios and tools. Implications for researchers, system developers, and groupware implementers are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1995,4,115,148

But despite the interface consistency guidelines and standards that are based on transfer of learning assumptions, few studies have investigated the effects of interface consistency, especially when a user interacts with multiple applications. The user's knowledge of a computer application is often described as a mental model. This study tested whether the consistency of the user interface across applications affects mental-model development when a user learns and uses multiple applications. One hundred and fourteen participants learned two prototype cooperative work applications in a controlled laboratory setting. Interface consistency across applications was manipulated for two attributes commonly referred to in interface design guidelines: the visual appearance of the display screen and the action language syntax. As hypothesized, inconsistent action language syntax across applications resulted in more user actions to complete tasks. Inconsistent visual appearance, however, resulted in greater accuracy, which was surprising. This study provides support for the consistency guideline for action language syntax, but a distinctive visual appearance rather than a consistent one might help the user form more accurate mental models when initially learning multiple applications. Schema theory is used to explain both the expected and the unexpected results. Implications and promising research directions are proposed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1998,4,167,193

While this approach generally works well in practice, there remains the problem of where to begin, especially if the designer does not have much experience. Based on limited field studies, we find that preferences for information, both in terms of the content and the format of the data, vary with decision focus (tactical vs. strategic), environmental stability, and, in some cases, experience.

The first step in the risk management process is to identify the risk itself, so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. One problem in this task, however, is that no validated lists are available to help the project manager understand the nature and types of risks typically faced in a software project. This paper represents a first step toward alleviating this problem by developing an authoritative list of common risk factors. We deploy a rigorous data collection method called a ""ranking-type"" Delphi survey to produce a rank-order list of risk factors. This data collection method is designed to elicit and organize opinions of a panel of experts through iterative, controlled feedback. Three simultaneous surveys were conducted in three different settings: Hong Kong, Finland, and the United States. This was done to broaden our view of the types of risks, rather than relying on the view of a single culture--an aspect that has been ignored in past risk management research. In forming the three panels, we recruited experienced project managers in each country. The paper presents the obtained risk factor list, compares it with other published risk factor lists for completeness and variation, and analyzes common features and differences in risk factor rankings in the three countries. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for both research and improving risk management practice.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2001,4,5,36

To improve their markets and to reduce investors' trading costs, these exchanges are introducing new rules and systems for handling investors' orders. The redesign of a market structure raises important strategic issues for exchanges; more attractive trading mechanisms will increase order flow and improve liquidity, but margins and total profits earned by traditional exchange intermediaries may be reduced. To examine the consequences of market structure changes, we conducted experimental tests of the integration of an order-driven trading system into a dealer/quote-driven market. Using computer-based simulations of a stock market, experimental subjects traded using a traditional dealer quote screen to which a public limit order facility was added. Data captured on subjects' trading decisions revealed that the limit order system was used by the subjects, attracting some orders that would have otherwise gone to dealers, and lowered investor trading costs. The integration of limit orders reduced dealers' activities as a percentage of total market volume and lowered dealers' trading margins, except in a special ""informed dealer"" case.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,2,57,79

They need interorganizational learning to help them cope with the complexity of new products and the capital intensity in the disk drive industry.

The popular reengineering literature advocates employee empowerment-decentralizing decision authority and consolidating tasks as complementary strategies. Our analysis reveals, however, that implementing these two changes simultaneously is suboptimal in many cases. Decentralization and consolidation decisions can occur separately or together; the optimal combination depends on the effectiveness of technology aimed at skill enhancement and the customers' sensitivity to time and quality. We identify those process parameters that can cause decentralization and consolidation to have opposite effects on process performance; we also point to other parameters, such as customer-to-customer variability, which can cause them to complement one another. Finally, we explain why, in a time-based competitive marketplace, firms are more likely to centralize their decision-making process while concentrating their information technology investments on enhancing productivity and intraorganizational communications.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,2,33,56

Furthermore, the OSS-SS vendor in these markets is better off by having lower usability than PS. Therefore, the PS vendor has little incentive to improve the usability of their software in these markets. On the other hand, in software markets characterized by high network benefits, a PS vendor is threatened by the presence of OSS-SS and can survive only if the PS is more usable than the competing OSS-SS.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,1,233,257

Despite the importance of the license type and developers to OSS projects, there is little understanding in open source literature of the license choice from a developer's perspective. The results from our empirical study of OSS developers reveal that the intrinsic motivation of challenge (problem solving) is associated with the developers' preference for licenses with moderate restrictions, while the extrinsic motivation of status (through peer recognition) is associated with developers' preference for licenses with least restrictions. We also find that when choosing an OSS license, a developer's attitude toward the software redistribution rights conflicts with his or her attitude toward preserving the social benefits of open source. A major implication of our findings is that OSS managers who want to attract a limited number of highly skilled programmers to their open source project should choose a restrictive OSS license. Similarly, managers of software projects for social programs could attract more developers by choosing a restrictive OSS license.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,207,239

Such variations affect service levels, especially under fixed resource constraints. We explore the possible role of periodic demand information sharing and subsequent resource-level adjustments as a means of addressing issues arising from demand variation. As information exchange alters the dynamics of the relationship between the customer and provider organizations, incorporating information sharing in service-level agreements requires modifying current pricing schemes. A pricing heuristic is developed and tested under varying levels of information accuracy and granularity. The heuristic is shown to provide better economic welfare for both participants in comparison to the baseline pricing strategies considered. Also, it is shown that information, even at a coarse level of granularity, is very effective in providing stable service levels--a finding that is encouraging for enhanced collaborations between customer and provider organizations in outsourcing arrangements.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2010,4,287,316

The findings show that: (1) certain programmers use different types of comprehension processes depending on their familiarity with the application domain (flexible approach), while others do not (top-down and bottom-up approaches); (2) familiarity with the application domain and the use of a particular comprehension process have marked effects on references programmers make to both application and programming domain knowledge; and (3) programmers who use a flexible comprehension process achieved the highest levels of comprehension. The present research also examines some cognitive determinants of the comprehension process. The findings highlight the need to consider application, as well as programming, domain knowledge as areas of computer programming expertise, to investigate factors influencing use of specific comprehension processes, and to develop tools to support flexible comprehension processes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,1,51,78

This paper extends a model, which merges previous multi-issue and actor-focused methods, based on power relationships between stakeholders and their ability to bargain in order to increase their utility. The model has already used for assessing a public WLAN landscape. The paper emphasizes the dynamic application of the model we developed for experimenting the negotiation evolution, shifting positions on some issues, and exchanging positions between actors. We also claim that such forecasting analyses of negotiation landscapes can be significantly improved using more appropriate visualization support. We propose new visualization tools for analyzing negotiation outcomes, representing negotiation landscapes, and applying what-if simulations, using passive influence, expected outcome and dissatisfaction, power distribution, proximity, and negotiation maps.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2005,4,137,172

However, research on DL, which includes psychomotor, cognitive, and affective skills, is virtually nonexistent. Indeed, DL for psychomotor skills has been viewed as impossible. Laboratory coursework, which we define as including the acquisition of psychomotor, cognitive, and affective skills, has become a limiting factor in the growth of DL. What is needed is a synergistic integration of technologies and human-computer interface (HCI) principles from computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), collaborative learning systems, and immersive presence technologies to enable achievement of psychomotor learning objectives. This paper defines the computer-supported collaborative learning requiring immersive presence (CSCLIP) research area, provides a theoretical foundation for CSCLIP, and develops an agenda for research in CSCLIP to establish a foundation for the study of this emerging area. It also briefly describes a CSCLIP-based telecommunications lab currently under development.

However, learning OO techniques can be a difficult process. This study investigates students' perceptions of the difficulties in learning and using OO techniques. Two groups of students who had recently completed a sixteen-week course on OO systems development participated in the study. Cognitive mapping techniques implemented with group support system (GSS) technology were used to gather information on the students' perceptions. The groups used the GSS to identify what was difficult about learning and using OO techniques, classify these concepts into categories, rank the relative importance of each category, and determine the relationships among the categories. Importance rankings of the categories show that learning basic object concepts was most important to and most difficult for the students, followed by design issues, and programming techniques. Composite cognitive maps of the shared perceptions of group members suggest that educators and industry trainers can reduce the difficulties of learning OO concepts by teaching simplified methodologies and controlling difficulties of the programming environment.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,2,103,131

The meetings were part of a national study aiming to upgrade New Zealand's competitive position in global markets. The aim of the research is to determine if electronic meeting technology could support an economic development process where participants came from a variety of backgrounds (e.g., business competitors, different ethnic groups) and where meeting urgency and efficiency were of prime importance. A multiple case approach was adopted. The meetings were organized and facilitated by the coordinator of the national study. Research data were gathered by observing the meetings, by questionnaires administered to participants, and by interviews with the coordinator and his staff. Analysis of these data indicates that participants felt that the meetings were both very effective and efficient.

In this paper, we hypothesize that the ""check-ins"" made by friends help users learn the potential payoff of visiting a venue. We argue that this learning-in-a-network process differs from the classic observational learning model in a subtle yet important way: Rather than from anonymous others, the agents learn from their network friends, about whose tastes in experience goods the agents are better informed. The empirical analyses are conducted on a unique data set in which we observe both the explicit interpersonal relationships and their ensuing check-ins. The key result is that the proportion of checked-in friends is not positively associated with the likelihood of a new visit, rejecting the prediction of the conventional observational learning model. Drawing on the literature in sociology and computer science, we show that weighting the friends' check-ins by a parsimonious proximity measure can yield a more intuitive result than the plain proportion does. Repeated check-ins by friends are found to have a pronounced effect. Our empirical result calls for the revisiting of observational learning in a social network setting. It also suggests that practitioners should incorporate network proximity when designing social recommendation products and conducting promotional campaigns in a social network.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,2,185,212

As proof of this concept, we have developed a prototype distributed multimedia information network incorporating the DHS model. Dubbed the Textile Design Image Database System (TDIDS), this database aids designers using apparel computer-aided design (CAD) systems in different locations, collaborating or working separately, in the design of clothes, including kimonos. Our purpose has been to create a database that will allow each designer to make the best use of his or her creativity and originality--his or her ""style and sensitivity to beauty,"" or, in Japanese, kansei. In our hypermedia system, ""metanodes"" are defined as abstract nodes that are dynamically organized by multimedia objects, while ""metalinks"" are defined as flexible kansei links. Metanodes and metalinks are combined to organize a dynamic hypermedia space from which users can easily retrieve desired design image objects by querying a knowledge agent. The knowledge agent, utilizing the knowledge base, creates links from kansei word objects provided by the user to suitable design image objects among those stored on multimedia databases distributed across the network. The knowledge agent also performs query conversion of individual users' subjective kansei (idiosyncratic, subjective use of kansei words) into objective kansei words using each user's own ""user model."" These objective kansei words are then converted to equivalent color values. Color value is the means by which all stored design images are characterized. This dynamic linking of kansei word objects to equivalent design images allows individual users' kansei to influence the retrieval process. The sophisticated and flexible CAD systems of the future will require multimedia database systems with cooperative supporting capabilities similar to our kansei system.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,3,25,44

Redesigned processes require a corresponding alignment in organizational control to sustain reengineering effectiveness. Inadequate attention to these issues can expose reengineered systems to excessive risks or produce reengineering attempts that are prematurely self-defeating as they contradict the underlying control philosophy. This paper addresses the question of whether traditional management controls have been eliminated, compromised, or rendered irrelevant amid such dynamic organizational changes, and, if so, how the management control function in a reengineered organization evolves. This question was explored through an intensive case study of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. The analysis suggests a restructuring of control dependency through automation and cooperation with external agencies, a shift in management practices toward more refined segmentation of control practices and greater leverage on back-end control, and increased reliance on outcome control. The challenge of ensuring proper implementation of such controls, given the deep-rooted traditional control culture, is not trivial. Implications and suggestions for assessing the risks and benefits of organizational control are discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,1,69,92

At best cost-benefit is determined ""post facto."" The current emphasis on management information systems and decision support systems further obscures the early evaluation process because it is difficult to pre-determine the benefits that are expected. Research conducted in the life insurance industry, using data collected from many companies, reveals: â€”that the economic benefit of automated systems might be evaluated best by measurements involving a company's entire expenditure for information processing as opposed to the economic benefits derived from individual systems; â€”that too little spent for information processing could have a negative impact on the total expense position of a company relative to other companies; â€”that expenditures for some components of information processing have a greater impact on the total expense position of a company. While continued attempts to measure the benefits of individual systems are encouraged, the results suggest that economic benefit should also be measured based on the composite of all expenditures for information processing. Perhaps other companies of different industries should be motivated to pursue this approach.",Journal of Management Information Systems,3,1986,2,22,32

Silver,User Prescriptions of Decision Support System Restrictiveness: An Experiment, decision support systems;  user perception of information systems;  system restrictiveness,"We often think of decision support systems (DSS) simply as expanding managerial information-processing capabilities. When a manager relies on the functional capabilities of a particular DSS in solving a problem, however, he or she is actually restricted to some subset of the full range of possible decision-making processes. DSS builders may wish to use this ""restrictiveness"" characteristic as a design variable, deliberately choosing the ways in which a DSS restricts its users. To do so effectively, builders need to know whether restrictiveness should be treated as an absolute or a relative; attribute. A key research question, therefore, is whether all users will be restricted identically by a given DSS. This paper reports on an experiment exploring if and how different users of the same DSS differ in their perceptions of system restrictiveness. Subjects used three DSS and ranked them from most to least restrictive. The results indicated that, while there was a significant similarity among rankings, there were also substantial differences. Several factors contributing to the perceptual differences were identified; these can serve as the basis for further research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,5,1988,1,51,65

According to software engineering folklore, the architecture and the organization of software depend on the communication patterns of the contributors. Communication patterns among developers influence knowledge sharing among them. Unlike in a formal organization, the communication network structures in an OSS project evolve unrestricted and unplanned. We develop a non-cooperative game-theoretic model to investigate the network formation in an OSS team and to characterize the stable and efficient structures. Developer heterogeneity in the network is incorporated based on their informative value. We find that there may exist several stable structures that are inefficient and there may not always exist a stable structure that is efficient. The tension between the stability and efficiency of structures results from developers acting in their self-interest rather than the group interest. Whenever there is such tension, the stable structure is either underconnected across types or overconnected within type of developers from an efficiency perspective. We further discuss how an administrator can help evolve a stable network into an efficient one. Empirically, we use the latent class model and analyze two real-world OSS projects hosted at SourceForge. For each project, different types of developers and a stable structure are identified, which fits well with the predictions of our model. Overall, our study sheds light on how developer abilities and incentives affect communication network formation in OSS projects.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,179,210

Whereas most studies comparing data mining methods have employed accuracy as a performance measure, we argue that, for problems such as credit evaluation, the focus should be on minimizing misclassification cost. We first generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the classifiers and use the area under the curve (AUC) measure to compare aggregate performance of the five methods over the spectrum of decision thresholds. Next, using the ROC results, we propose a method for tuning the classifiers by identifying optimal decision thresholds. We compare the methods based on expected costs across a range of cost-probability ratios. In addition to expected cost and AUC, we evaluate the models on the basis of their generalizability to unseen data, their scalability to other problems in the domain, and their robustness against changes in class distributions. We found that the performance of logistic regression and neural network models was superior under most conditions. In contrast, decision tree and nearest neighbor models yielded higher costs, and were much less generalizable and robust than the other models. An important finding of this research is that the models can be effectively tuned post hoc to make them cost sensitive, even though they were built without incorporating misclassification costs.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,3,249,280

Researchers have been unable to conclude that IT spending by an organization results in increases in key performance indicators. Two major recent studies have attempted to address the issue by putting greater emphasis on the theoretical underpinnings of the solution to the problem, although they chose different theoretical frameworks. The present study extends that work to yield a framework that shows the relationship between firm performance and both IT and corporate investments. The data used to validate the framework exceeds that used in previous analyses in both quality and quantity, thereby permitting appropriate statistical analyses. A large database consisting of over 2,000 observations of 624 firms was constructed, using data provided by the International Data Corporation, Standard & Poor's Compustat, and Moody's. This allowed the authors to pose the following research questions: (a) Can the relationship between sets of investment measures and firm performance be demonstrated (as opposed to individual measures)? (b) How are IT investments related to a firm's market value, market share, sales, and assets? and (c) Is there a difference in the effect of computer capital and noncomputer capital?",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,2000,4,69,97

The authors examine support for these assertions by comparing the financial characteristics of firms that enter into large-scale IS outsourcing agreements with those of other firms in their respective industries prior to outsourcing. A year-by-year comparison around the time of outsourcing indicates that firms that outsource their IS have significantly lower overhead costs, lower cash reserves, and higher debt before the outsourcing event. Analysis of changes in financial characteristics reveals an increase in long-term debt and financial leverage and declining growth rates prior to the outsourcing event. The authors argue that firms enter into large-scale IS outsourcing agreements primarily to reduce costs and to generate cash. Consequently, they are more likely to outsource when they have lower cash reserves, higher debt, or declining growth.

Despite the increasing relevance of such interactions, the implications of agreement or disagreement on the fulfillment of critical service quality factors for successful alignment and higher user satisfaction are far from being well understood. While prior research has extensively studied the question of matching different viewpoints on IS service quality in organizations, little or no attention has been paid to the role of perceptual congruence or incongruence in the dyadic relationship between IS professionals and users in forming user satisfaction with the IS function. Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory, prospect theory, and perceptual congruence research, this study examines survey responses from 169 matching pairs of IS professionals and users in different organizations and explains how perceptual fit patterns affect user satisfaction with the IS function. The paper demonstrates that perceptual congruence can, in and of itself, have an impact on user satisfaction, which goes beyond what was found before. Moreover, the results of the study reveal the relevance of nonlinear and asymmetric effect mechanisms arising from perceptual (in)congruence that may affect user satisfaction. This study extends our theoretical understanding of the role of perceptual alignment or misalignment on IS service quality factors in forming user satisfaction and lays the foundation for further study of the interplay between perceptions in the dyadic relationship between IS professionals and IS users. Managers who seek to encourage particular behaviors by the IS professionals or IS users may use the results of this study to reconcile the often troubled business-IT relationship.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,63,96

The focus is on how OIS can increase the potential power and influence of an individual. I have drawn from power base theory to identify five bases of power that would, hypothetically, provide the potential for an individual's influence in an organization: (1) resource provision; (2) irreplaceability; (3) authority; (4) network centrality; and (5) expertise. To explore this conceptual model, data were collected from 136 users of well-established office information systems. This pilot study provides general support for our model that the impact of OIS on potential personal influence can be explained through its effects on the five power bases. In particular, the data indicate that network centrality is the most significant contributor to potential personal influence for administrative personnel, while resource provision is the most significant factor for technical personnel.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,2,135,151

Tree induction gives the lowest rate of false positive predictions, and a version of discriminant analysis yields the lowest rate of false negatives for multiple category problems, but neural networks give the best overall results for the largest multiple classification cases. There is substantial room for improvement in overall performance for all techniques.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,1,37,62

Mock,Evidential Reasoning for WebTrust Assurance Services, assurance services;  decision theory;  electronic commerce;  risk management;  WebTrust,"We study two aspects of assurance services in electronic commerce. The first deals with the type(s) of evidential networks that will allow a professional accountant to provide assurance. Here, we develop an evidential network model for ""WebTrust Assurance,"" a service being provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA). Our model augments the AICPA/CICA approach and provides goals, subgoals and evidence relevant to the overall assurance to be provided. The aggregation of evidence and the resolution of uncertainties follow the belief-function approach. Next we develop a decision-theoretic model for the assurance-planning problem. Our approach is based on estimating the expected value of providing various levels of assurance and is illustrated with several different scenarios that may be faced in practice. We also consider the role of ambiguity in decision situations such as planning WebTrust engagements and calculate bounds in expected value based on whether auditors are conservative or not in their approach to risk.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,3,11,32

Teo,Contract Performance in Offshore Systems Development: Role of Control Mechanisms, contract performance;  control mechanisms;  control modes;  control theory;  interaction effects;  offshoring;  outsourcing;  project governance;  software development,"Although control theory has often been invoked to explain the coordination between client and vendor for information systems development (ISD), insights into its moderating effects for explicating ISD contract performance, especially in the offshore context, is rather limited. Such insights would enable better understanding of variables that have complementary or substitutive effects on performance. Further, the control literature talks about different control modes (e.g., formal and informal control modes classified as behavior, outcome, clan, and self-control modes) without adequately distinguishing among the different control mechanisms enacting each of the control modes. In this research, by explicitly classifying the distinctions that exist within each of the control modes, we uncover the key role played by mechanistic governance in outsourced ISD. Grounding our arguments in the information requirement for performance evaluation, the study theorizes the moderating influence of mechanistic governance on the relationships of contract specificity and relational governance with ISD quality and cost performance. We test the theorized model in a field study comprising 160 offshore ISD projects executed by Indian vendors. Our results establish the significant complementary role of mechanistic governance on the relationships of contract specificity with both cost and quality performance variables. Further, mechanistic governance substitutes the impact of relational governance on cost performance. Thus, the study theoretically as well as empirically establishes the need for conceptualizing mechanistic governance as a viable and significant governance mechanism for offshore ISD contracts. The study also teases out the distinctions between the two prime contract types in vogue for managing offshore ISD contracts, namely, fixed price and time and materials contracts. The study thus contributes not only to control theory but also to the stream of literature examining offshore ISD contracts. Further, the study provides insights to managers on having well-specified contracts and acknowledging the role of mechanistic governance for better performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,115,158

Systems development and implementation offer an opportunity for higher-order organizational learning that is rarely exploited. Advanced information systems, in particular expert systems (ES) and executive information systems (EIS), provide ample opportunities for higher-order organizational learning if the development process is structured in certain ways. This work includes an analysis of three organizations in terms of project outcomes, organizational learning outcomes, and organizational performance. On the basis of these assessments, five critical success factors are identified that may contribute to organizational learning during advanced system development. The relationships between these factors and organizational outcomes are summarized in a preliminary model that can form the basis for future research.

Despite the proliferation of methodologies and models for requirements analysis, empirical work examining their relative efficacy is limited. This paper presents an empirical examination of object-oriented and process-oriented methodologies as applied to object-oriented and process-oriented tasks. The conceptual basis of the research model is derived from the theory of cognitive fit, which posits that superior problem-solving performance will result when the problem-solving task and the problem-solving tool emphasize the same type of information. Two groups of subjects participated in an experiment that required them to construct solutions to two requirements-modeling tasks, one process-oriented and the other object-oriented. One group employed the object-oriented tool while the other used the process-oriented tool. As predicted by the theory of cognitive fit, superior performance was observed when the process-oriented tool was applied to the process-oriented task. For the object-oriented task, however, the performance effects of cognitive fit require further investigation since there was no difference in subject performance across the two tools.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,2,137,162

Based on previous SERVQUAL and SaaS literature, field interviews and focus groups, a card-sorting exercise, and two surveys of SaaS using companies, we develop, refine, and test SaaS-Qual, a zones-of-tolerance (ZOT)-based service quality measurement instrument specifically for SaaS solutions. Besides validating already established service quality dimensions (i.e., rapport, responsiveness, reliability, and features), we identify two new factors (i.e., security and flexibility) that are essential for the evaluation of service quality of SaaS solutions. SaaS-Qual demonstrates strong psychometric properties and shows high nomological validity within a framework that predicts the continued use of SaaS solutions by existing customers. In addition to developing a validated instrument that provides a fine-grained measurement of SaaS service quality, we also enrich existing research models on information systems continuance. Moreover, the SaaS-Qual instrument can be used as a diagnostic tool by SaaS providers and users alike to spot strengths and weaknesses in the service delivery of SaaS solutions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,3,85,126

Lack of interoperability across systems is especially problematic for manufacturers dependent on global supply chains. We develop propositions about the characteristics of IOS that affect information transparency in supply chains. Specifically, we propose that data and process standards are necessary, but not sufficient, to solve such information transparency problems. Instead, standards need to be complemented by hub-type information technology architectures that are shared by organizations participating in an industrial field, not just by the participants in one manufacturer's supply chain. These arguments are supported by an automotive industry case study involving data and process standardization and a shared, cloud-based architecture. We conclude with additional aspects of the case that may be relevant to addressing information transparency problems in global supply chains.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,2,75,108

This is because tacit knowledge is inherently elusive, and in order to capture, store, and disseminate it, it is argued that it first has to be made explicit. However, such a process is difficult, and often fails due to three reasons: (1) we are not necessarily aware of our tacit knowledge, (2) on a personal level, we do not need to make it explicit in order to use it, and (3) we may not want to give up a valuable competitive advantage. During an empirical study of recommender system usage, it was noticed how such technology could be used to circumvent these problems, and make tacit knowledge, in the form of our professional interests, available to the organization as a whole. Using Polanyi's theories, it will be shown how intranet documents can be used to make tacit knowledge tangible without becoming explicit, suggesting that tacitly expressed entities are not necessarily beyond the reach of information technology.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,3,9,24

Budgeting offices in the executive branches of state governments are increasingly utilizing a wide variety of information systems technologies to manage and track funds, engage in financial planning, and undertake sophisticated financial analysis. These offices are the ""nerve centers"" for financial planning, evaluation, and management of funds for state-level programs and policies. This report explores two distinct issues within the context of technology and management in state budgeting offices. The first is an examination of the role that technology plays in the organizational structures and practices of these offices. In this regard, the thirty-eight budgeting offices in the sample demonstrated a comprehensive pattern of information systems use that compares favorably with technology use in other levels of government and reflects the multiple roles that public managers in these offices must play. The second issue is an assessment of the association between environmental, organizational, and technological factors, and the adoption and utilization of information systems technology. Surrogate variables for each of the three theoretical factors were found to be associated with increased adoption and use of technology in the offices surveyed. An argument is made for a theoretical perspective on the adoption and utilization of technology that attempts to integrate each of these three perspectives.",Journal of Management Information Systems,8,1991,1,107,128

The study finds that the perceived relationship caused by a link leads to positive effects for the less reputable of the linked organizations, but negative effects for the more reputable organization. These effects are exaggerated or attenuated depending on the reputation of the organization that sends the link. The effect of presenting the link as an advertisement or a link to a partner was also examined, but no effect was uncovered, raising the question of how organizations may effectively differentiate links on their Web sites.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,1,183,210

Previous research has identified several content-related features as well as user and network characteristics that may drive information diffusion. However, little research has focused on the relationship between emotions and information diffusion in a social media setting. In this paper, we examine whether sentiment occurring in social media content is associated with a user's information sharing behavior. We carry out our research in the context of political communication on Twitter. Based on two data sets of more than 165,000 tweets in total, we find that emotionally charged Twitter messages tend to be retweeted more often and more quickly compared to neutral ones.

We analyze the change tactics of three organizations' BPR initiatives to understand whether and how revolutionary tactics were used. The initiatives evinced a varied amount of revolutionary tactics depending on the scope and depth of planned change. The use of revolutionary tactics also varied by the phase of the initiatives. The frequency of revolutionary tactics was highest in the early phases of the initiatives and decreased as they approached implementation. We explore the reasons for reduced deployment of revolutionary tactics. We conclude by implications to BPR practice and research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,1,81,107

Investigations into this line of inquiry have almost always used constructs related to individual firm performance as their dependent measures, an approach that made sense under historical economic conditions. In recent years, however, value chains are giving way to digital supply networks with electronic interactions between tiers in the flow of goods and services. Such an environment makes it imperative to develop sophisticated measures of the performance of entire networks of firms, as opposed to individual firm performance. Using game-theoretic concepts, this paper explores several dimensions of networked organizational performance as a construct, as a set of measures, and as a construct within a nomology. It describes a program of research in which some empirical validation has already been completed and other work is now underway.

This technology has also been studied from conceptual and design perspectives. In this paper we consider how GDSS can be used to improve group decisions in face-to-face conferencing (""decision rooms""), remote site teleconferencing, and remote/local computer conferencing. These prospects have been aided by advances in telecommunications technology and GDSS seems poised for successful integration into modern organizations. This study looks at the actual ways in which GDSS are currently being utilized. The framework for the study was derived from DeSanctis and Gallupe's work; a survey of 135 randomly selected Data Processing Management Association (DPMA) members was used as the sample base. Based on preliminary data analysis, it appears that GDSS are slowly being introduced and supported by information system (IS) departments and that this pattern will be the trend for the immediate future as well. Data analysis will be completed in the near future, but analytical procedures are delineated in the paper. These procedures take two primary forms. Descriptive statistics based on the study data will assess the extent to which organizations are increasing their commitment to GDSS and which current implementations are heaviest in each of the GDSS types. Factor analysis of respondent data will also be used to assess taskgroup usage of GDSS, task groups including: (1) planning, (2) administrative, and (3) data analysis tasks. The study will also assess whether usage of GDSS varies significantly with certain organizational size variables. A better understanding of these relationships should greatly assist IS managers in allocating resources to this new technology and in making the case for GDSS to top management. It should also help GDSS software developers formulate new design features.",Journal of Management Information Systems,5,1988,1,101,116

This study investigates the differential effects of provider recommendations (PRs) and consumer reviews (CRs) on the instrumental, affective, and trusting dimensions of consumer beliefs and shows how these beliefs ultimately influence continued OPR usage and product purchase intentions. This study tests a conceptual model linking PRs and CRs to four consumer beliefs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived affective quality, and trust) in two different product settings (search products versus experience products). Results of an experimental study show that users of PRs express significantly higher perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use than users of CRs, while users of CRs express higher trusting beliefs and perceived affective quality than users of PRs, resulting in different effect mechanisms toward OPR reuse and purchase intentions in e-commerce transactions. Further, CRs were found to elicit higher perceived usefulness, trusting beliefs, and perceived affective quality for experience goods, while PRs were found to unfold higher effects on all of these variables for search goods.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,237,272

The problems of inadequate profitability measurement are intensified in today's business environments, where changing margins due to deregulation and new entrants, new products with unknown costs, and customer sophistication in locating low-cost providers often combine to leave unprepared firms with growing numbers of loss-making client relationships. In response, firms in a number of service and manufacturing industries are experimenting with new methods for measuring performance, and are implementing these techniques using information systems. The collection and analysis of information on the profitability of customer relationships enables managers to identify and defend their most attractive market segments, and to turn loss-making accounts into profitable ones. The London-based securities house, BZW, developed BEATRICE, an innovative information system that combines activity-based accounting principles and a model of customer profitability to make an income assignment to each of the 6,000 trades the firm makes in a day.

Major issues--notably, security and product quality uncertainty--still pose serious challenges to the further adoption of electronic commerce. Traditional market transactions have a long history and well-understood protections for buyers and sellers. In the electronic markets, formal and informal mechanisms such as trusted third parties (TTP) have emerged trying to ensure safe transactions . In this paper, we investigate under what conditions people will stick to the traditional market and face-to-face transactions, and under what conditions electronic transactions will be the convention of the future. Of particular interest is the role of TTPs in facilitating online transactions. Using evolutionary game theory, we present an analytical model of buyer and seller choices and examine which patterns of transactions can be sustained. We further study how the traders' adaptive behavior may influence the outcome of the market evolution. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that the market will show divergence: for commodity products, electronic transactions through TTPs will get established as the convention for market transactions when traders use historical information about other traders' past strategies. For ""look and feel"" products, the market evolution depends on the initial distribution of the transaction strategies in the population.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2005,4,173,197

We build on prior literature in transaction cost economics (TCE) to argue that the contract design should address ex post transaction costs that result due to contractual incompleteness and opportunism. We argue that contract design is multidimensional, and that it is necessary to design governance structures that can protect user firms from shirking and monitoring costs, as well as provide for efficient adaptation when requirements are incompletely specified at the start of the initiative. Our empirical analysis suggests that factors such as uncertainty in specifying service requirements, interdependence between the ASP application and IT systems in the client organization, and the need for specific investments favor time and materials contracts, whereas fixed prices are desirable when strong incentives are needed for cost reduction. We also find that contracts that are aligned with transaction attributes in a transaction cost--economizing manner are significantly less likely to experience budget overruns and realize better ex post performance than those that are not. These results hold normative implications for both user and provider firms to assess the performance implications of choosing contracts in line with prescriptions of TCE.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,2,205,240

We draw upon agency theory and modularity theory to propose that one of the central challenges in service disaggregation is that of knowledge interdependencies across client and provider organizations. The resulting lack of verifiability of certain tasks results in a multitask agency problem. Our key research questions involve (1) the suitability of high- versus low-powered incentives in SaaS contracts when the outsourced tasks involve business analytics that are difficult to verify, and (2) how such contract choices are affected by the modularity of interfaces between the client and the provider. Analysis of data collected from 154 providers of SaaS offering a range of IT services supports our contention that when contracting for business analytics characterized by knowledge interdependencies across clients and providers, incentives should be ""low powered."" Modularity in the interfaces of the service provider increases the desirability of high-powered incentives in such situations. Our results are robust after accounting for endogeneity issues arising from unobserved matching between service providers and the nature of IT services outsourced by clients. With the increasing importance of information systems in services, this paper suggests that arm's-length relationships and high-powered incentives may be ineffective in incentivizing providers to perform on complex business analytic tasks, unless accompanied by the modularization of interfaces.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2010,4,87,117

While there are a growing number of interorganizational systems (IOS) designed for the public, there is little study of and lack of clear guidelines on managing change related to their implementation. This research explores the phenomenon through the case study of a country-wide farecard system implemented in Singapore's public transportation system that involved several organizations and the public. Through the case analysis, we identified critical success factors (CSFs) for change management in IOS for the public and interrelated them using a causal loop diagram (CLD). These factors included refinements of existing CSFs identified from the literature as well as new CSFs from our case study. Our case analysis showed that communication through senior management and cooperation of affected organizations in the system implementation was able to overcome resistance to change in these organizations. We also found that while comprehensive publicity could initiate change in the public, a critical mass had to be built up for managing public change by coopting public opinion leaders as well. By interrelating CSFs identified in the case via a CLD, this study provides a preliminary theoretical framework for studying change management in IOS for the public and aims to guide practitioners in implementing such systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,133,175

New activity in the field is booming, as a result of civilian and government programs that are investing more time and money in ES development Early initiatives, aided by improvements in computer hardware and software, have successfully created ESs to rival human experts within some narrow problem domains. The study is guided by the notions of organizational programs as defined by March and Simon [3], and the information-processing capacity of the firm as defined by Galbraith [1,2] to organize, describe, and compare the effects of ES use across the site. It was clearly shown that, within the definition, the information-processing capacity of the PlanPower site did increase from pre-ES to post-ES. The interesting implication of the increased information processing capacity was that the firm (The Financial Collaborative) seemed to gobble up the capacity and create new issues and concerns. Instead of the task becoming more certain and more simple, as one might expect with increased information-processing capacity, the task mutated and the firm began to operate with a higher need for information-processing capacity. The ES seemed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the user firm. The price of the benefits was an increased rigidity in the task. In considering ESs, a manager should be concerned not only with the ES itself, but with the process by which the ES is adapted, and the overall process of creating and using the ES. In addition, the manager needs to consider the effects of the ES on the uncertainty associated with the task and should consciously manage that uncertainty to foster the level of adaptation necessary to keep the ES alive and viable in the organization.",Journal of Management Information Systems,6,1989,3,65,84

A further goal is to provide guidelines for the design of NSS. Compared with a control condition, visualization improved three aspects of negotiations: visualization support aided negotiators' convergence of perceptions of reality and had positive socio-emotional consequences in terms of increasing cohesiveness and entitativity. As a result, groups with visualization support reached consensus more easily and were more satisfied with the process.

We draw on relevant research in learning and cognitive psychology to clarify the conditions under which mentoring and storytelling can be most effective as carriers of knowledge. Finally, we present recommendations for specific managerial practices that follow from our analysis.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,1,95,114

We frame this investigation in terms of a key question; How rigid are prices on the Internet? Are there reasons to suggest that prior predictions of more flexible prices on the Internet may not have been founded on the appropriate theoretical knowledge? We find that Internet retailers, in contrast with traditional firms, adjust prices any day of the week throughout the year. Yet firms' price adjustments for books occur much less frequently than daily--every 90 days on average. For most observers of Internet-based selling, this is surprising, because most expect more frequent price adjustments--based on the quality of technological environment that supports price-setting. In fact, our results show that price-change activity appears to vary by book category, from a high of one change, on average, every 61 days for best sellers to a low of one change every 184 days, on average, for steady sellers. In addition, we learned that individual firms exhibited different patterns for their price changes: Amazon changed book prices every 222 days, whereas BN changed its book prices more frequently, every 56 days on average.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,57,89

This paper attempts to help fill the gap between available subjective/argumentative theory and the necessary empirical evidence to evaluate and implement existing claims and design methodologies. An empirical study is described that explicitly focused on the usefulness of information in a strategic decision-making context. Factor analysis was employed in the derivation of five orthogonal dimensions of the usefulness of strategic information. The results suggest that strategic systems planning [20] may be preferable to historical, traditional approaches to providing useful information to strategic decision makers in a SDSS context. A research agenda is discussed that suggests avenues for studying strategic systems planning in the context of various planning processes contributing to SDSS development, of knowledge-based SDSSs, and of strategic expert systems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,5,1988,2,83,97

It observes the dynamics of model change from normal to crisis conditions and provides interpretation of bankruptcy classifications. The bankruptcy prediction model revealed that the major variables in predicting bankruptcy were ""cash flow to total assets"" and ""productivity of capital"" under normal conditions and ""cash flow to liabilities,"" ""productivity of capital,"" and ""fixed assets to stockholders equity and long-term liabilities"" under crisis conditions. The accuracy rates of final prediction models in normal conditions and in crisis conditions were found to be 83.3 percent and 81.0 percent, respectively. When the normal model was applied in crisis situations, prediction accuracy dropped significantly in the case of bankruptcy classification (from 66.7 percent to 36.7 percent) to the level of a blind guess (35.71 percent). Therefore, the need for a different model in crisis economic conditions is justified.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,1,63,85

In this paper, we go beyond the dominant firm-level alignment paradigm by utilizing a value disciplines perspective on strategic foci to conceptualize alignment at the process level. Theory would then suggest that alignment should be tightest in processes that are considered critical to each firm's strategic focus. Using data from matched surveys of IT and business executives at 241 firms, we detect support for this locus of alignment argument when alignment is identified using profile deviation or moderation. We also find a positive link between alignment and perceived IT business value in each of five primary processes in the value chain. By bringing a process-level view to the study of alignment and its impacts, we go beyond a discussion on the extent of fit--a cornerstone of the literature--to whether firms are pursuing the right type of fit for the particular mix of processes underlying their strategy. In this way, a process-level perspective can foster a deeper and more meaningful understanding of how alignment affects firm performance. Our results also show a need for managers to reconsider the steps taken to align IT and business strategy by looking more closely at how IT can support individual processes rather than at how IT can support an entire strategy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,3,227,268

Even as consolidation reduces the number of banks, small banks with under $100 million in assets continue to report higher profit margins than large banks with over $100 million in assets. Lacking scale, small banks employ a service-oriented business strategy (customer intimacy), whereas large banks focus on productivity and throughput (operational excellence). Information technology (IT) plays a key role in applying each strategy, but as banks move toward customer intimacy in general, the challenge is to grow without undermining service quality. Using a balanced panel data set from 43 U.S. banks, this paper finds that banking strategies are becoming more customer focused. Yet for large banks in particular, IT remains resolutely operations focused. This misalignment could restrict future banking performance. In this way, this paper contributes to the service science literature by using size to dissect banking strategies and performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2010,4,219,252

While earlier studies confirm the value of alignment, there is still some question as to how alignment creates value and the level at which value is created. In this research, we use a series of theoretical arguments based on the interconnected structure of the value chain to consider the extended effects of alignment at the process level. Since processes are often linked to create a complex chain of activities, the absence or presence of alignment in any process could have implications for business performance elsewhere in the value chain. Minimally aligned processes can not only disrupt performance within the focal process, but their effects may also be felt further downstream in the form of bottlenecks and a diminution in the business value of IT. Using a simplified form of the value chain and data from matched surveys of business and IT executives at 317 U.S. and EU firms, we examine how the effects of alignment on a given process spill over into processes further downstream, creating higher IT business value in those downstream processes. We also show that these spillover effects continue along the length of the value chain and do not diminish based on distance from the focal process. Our results reinforce the call for firms to improve the fit between business and IT strategy by showing how efforts to improve alignment in a given process can deliver a stream of benefits along the value chain. This research provides a fresh perspective on the value of alignment, facilitating a deeper understanding and appreciation of the link between strategic IT alignment and firm performance.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2011,3,9,44

Suggestions that researchers use perceptual measures instead are met with claims that the biased nature of perceptions renders them imperfect proxies for the true extent of IT impacts. In this paper, we use sensemaking theory to explore this claim. We outline a model relating what executives notice about process-level IT impacts with sensemaking-based perceptions of IT impacts at the firm level, and firm performance as the ultimate arbiter of perceptual accuracy. Estimating the model with survey data from executives in 196 firms, we find that executives' perceptions are more fact than fiction. While perceptions are not a perfect proxy for hard-to-find objective measures, perceptual accuracy should stimulate greater consideration of executives' perceptions in future IT business value research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,1,13,54

In response to this call, the authors develop a process-oriented model to assess the impacts of IT on critical business activities within the value chain. Their model incorporates corporate goals for IT and management practices as key determinants of realized IT payoffs. Using survey data from 304 business executives worldwide, they found that corporate goals for IT can be classified into one of four types: unfocused, operations focus, market focus, and dual focus. Their analysis confirms that these goals are useful indicators of payoffs from IT in that executives in firms with more focused goals for IT perceive greater payoffs from IT across the value chain. In addition, the authors found that management practices such as strategic alignment and IT investment evaluation contribute to higher perceived levels of IT business value.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,2000,4,145,173

Managing extreme amounts of data can be complex and challenging at a time when information is increasingly viewed as a strategic resource. Since the dominant focus of the information technology (IT) governance literature has been on how firms govern physical IT artifacts (hardware, software, networks), the goal of this study is to extend the theory of IT governance by uncovering the structures and practices used to govern information artifacts. Through detailed interviews with 37 executives in 30 organizations across 17 industries, we discover a range of structural, procedural, and relational practices used to govern information within a nomological net that includes the antecedents of these practices and their effects on firm performance. While some antecedents enable the speedy adoption of information governance, others can delay or limit the adoption of information governance practices. Once adopted, however, information governance can help to boost firm performance. By incorporating these results into an extended theory of IT governance, we note how information governance practices can unlock value from the ever-expanding mountains of data currently held within organizations.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,3,141,178

Three independent variables were studied: national culture (Singapore versus U.S.), task type (intellective versus preference), and communication medium (unsupported versus CMC). Three different facets of status effects were measured as dependent variables: status influence, sustained influence, and perceived influence. Singapore groups reported higher sustained influence than U.S. groups. Preference task groups experienced higher status influence and sustained influence than intellective task groups. Unsupported groups also had higher status influence and sustained influence compared to CMC groups. In addition, Singapore groups that completed the preference task in the unsupported setting reported higher perceived influence than groups under other treatments. These results demonstrate that CMC appears to be able to reduce status effects during group communication, both in Singapore and in the United States. This is especially true when groups are working on a preference task. Moreover, status influence appears to be more sustainable in Singapore groups, where group members appear to be more conscious of its presence, than in U.S. groups.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1998,1,119,141

The processes by which this mutual understanding is achieved, however, are not well understood. This article reports a study of the communication behaviors of systems analysts when they work with clients to determine systems requirements. The study hypothesizes that three key processes shifting perspective, managing transaction, and establishing rapport-affect mutual understanding. Twenty-eight systems analysts employed in government departments in Australia participated in the study. Their verbal and nonverbal behaviors during the interview with the clients were recorded on video-and audiotapes. These tapes were then analyzed using a content analysis method together with the perceptual responses obtained from interviews with the system analysts and their clients. The findings suggest that, while there is great variability in the communication behaviors of system analysts, there are nevertheless discernible styles and patterns of effective communication. The study has both theoretical and practical significance. It suggests that effective communication is the outcome of complex processes that are influenced by the personal and situational characteristics of the participants. It also provides clues for better-designed communication training programs. The findings of specific effective verbal and nonverbal behaviors can be incorporated into these training programs to improve the communicative behavior of systems analysts (and also other professionals), and so help them establish mutual understanding with clients.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1994,4,159,182

We develop a dynamic structural model to identify a contributor's underlying utility function from observed contribution behavior.

We develop analytic models of hidden information to analyze the effectiveness of these regimes to build trust and their efficiency in terms of social welfare. We find that firms' ability to influence consumer beliefs about trust depends on whether firms can send unambiguous signals to consumers regarding their intention of protecting privacy. Ambiguous signals can lead to a breakdown of consumer trust, while the clarity and credibility of the signal under industry self-regulation can lead to enhanced trust and improved social welfare. Our results also indicate that although overarching government regulations can enhance consumer trust, regulation may not be socially optimal in all environments because of lower profit margins for firms and higher prices for consumers.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2008,4,153,173

We first explain different ways in which ICTs can create stress in users and identify factors that create technostress. We next propose three hypotheses: (1) technostress is inversely related to individual productivity, (2) role stress is inversely related to individual productivity, and (3) technostress is directly related to role stress. We then use structural equation modeling on survey data from ICT users in 223 organizations to test the hypotheses. The results show support for them. Theoretically, the paper contributes in three ways. First, the different dimensions of technostress identified here add to existing concepts on stress experienced by individuals in organizations. Second, by showing that technostress inversely affects productivity, the paper reinforces that failure to manage the effects of ICT-induced stress can offset expected increases in productivity. Third, validation of the positive relationship between technostress and role stress adds a new conceptual thread to literature analyzing the relationship between technology and organizational roles and structure. In the practical domain, the paper proposes a diagnostic tool to evaluate the extent to which technostress is present in an organization and suggests that the adverse effects of technostress can be partly countered by strategies that reduce role conflict and role overload.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2007,1,301,328

Recent literature has encapsulated these cognitions in the concept of technostress, which is stress caused by an inability to cope with the demands of organizational computer usage. Given the critical role of the user in organizational information processing and accomplishing application-enabled workflows, understanding how these cognitions affect users' satisfaction with ICT and their performance in ICT-mediated tasks is an important step in appropriating benefits from current computing environments. The objective of this paper is to (1) understand the negative effects of technostress on the extent to which end users perceive the applications they use to be satisfactory and can utilize them to improve their performance at work and (2) identify mechanisms that can mitigate these effects. Specifically, we draw from the end-user computing and technostress literature to develop and validate a model that analyzes the effects of factors that create technostress on the individual's satisfaction with, and task performance using, ICT. The model also examines how user involvement in ICT development and support mechanisms for innovation can be used to weaken technostress-creating factors and their outcomes. The results, based on survey data analysis from 233 ICT users from two organizations, show that factors that create technostress reduce the satisfaction of individuals with the ICT they use and the extent to which they can utilize ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. Mechanisms that facilitate involvement of users, and encourage them to take risks, learn, explore new ideas, and experiment in the context of ICT use, diminish the factors that create technostress and increase satisfaction with the ICT they use. These mechanisms also have a positive effect on users' appropriation of ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. The paper contributes to emerging literature on negative outcomes of ICT use by (1) highlighting the influence of technostress on users' satisfaction and performance (i.e., productivity and innovation in ICT-mediated tasks) with ICT, (2) extending the literature on technostress, which has so far looked largely at the general behavioral and psychological domains, to include the domain of end-user computing, and (3) demonstrating the importance of user involvement and innovation support mechanisms in reducing technostress-creating conditions and their ICT use-related outcomes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,3,303,334

IMC is proposed as an emerging self-contained business process that interfaces with but remains separate from all other business elements, while providing unique services to those other elements. A generic model of EWIMC itself is presented that breaks down IMC into a set of systems federations, each functionally distinct from one another; each federation, in turn, is composed of more specific systems and each system its subsystems, and so on. Thus, a top-down, hierarchical approach is applied to the concept of IMC to provide a framework for understanding the complexities and interrelationships among its many pieces. The model is offered as a first step in developing a comprehensive overview of EWIMC to replace the numerous fragmented approaches offered in the past. An example of General Motors' architecture is presented. Finally, the System Planning Technique is presented as a tool for defining systems requirements.",Journal of Management Information Systems,5,1988,2,23,37

In particular, it examines methods for evaluating sequential exchange options in order to obtain estimates for the value of software growth options that is, IS functions that are embedded in an IT platform and that can be employed once the particular base system is installed and their use is economically justified.

Whereas Yahoo was the early market leader, there has been entry by both lower-quality engines and higher-quality ones (such as Google). Prior work on quality differentiation requires that low-quality products have low prices in order to survive in a market with high-quality products. However, the price charged to users of search engines is typically zero. Therefore, consumers do not face a tradeoff between quality and price. Why do lower-quality products survive in such a market? We develop a vertical differentiation model that explains this phenomenon. The quality of the results provided by a search engine is inherently stochastic, and there is no charge for using an engine. Therefore, users who try out one engine may consult a lower-quality engine in the same session. This ""residual demand"" allows lower-quality products to survive in equilibrium. We then extend our model to incorporate horizontal differentiation as well and show that residual demand leads to higher quality and less differentiation in this market. Engines want to attract competitors' customers and therefore have a strong incentive to be ""similar"" to each other.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,2,137,160

There is a need for software vendors to make software patches available in a timely manner for vulnerabilities in their products. We develop a survival analysis model of software vendors' patch release behavior and test it using a data set compiled from the National Vulnerability Database, United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, and vendor Web sites. This model helps to understand how factors specific to vulnerabilities, patches, software vendors, and software affect the patch release behavior of software vendors based on their cost structure. This study also analyzes the impact of the presence of multiple vendors and type of vendor on the patch release behavior of software vendors. Our results indicate that vulnerabilities with high confidentiality impact or high integrity impact are patched faster than vulnerabilities with high availability impact. Interesting differences in the patch release behavior of software vendors based on software type (new release versus update) and type of vendor (open source versus proprietary) are found. Our results illustrate that when there are legislative pressures, vendors react faster in patching vulnerabilities. Thus, appropriate regulations can be an important policy tool to influence vendor behavior toward socially desirable security outcomes.",Journal of Management Information Systems,28,2012,4,305,338

Although this issue has received significant attention in recent years, empirical research focusing specifically on BP-ISP integration is still relatively sparse. This research extends existing results by examining the evolution of BP-ISP integration and the contingency variables that may influence BP-ISP integration. The results confirmed the existence of an evolutionary pattern that can be defined in terms of movement through four types of BP-ISP integration: administrative integration to sequential integration to reciprocal integration to full integration. Only a few firms indicated that they had reached full integration. Bypassed phases and reverse evolution, though observed, were uncommon. Among the contingency variables, the business competence of the IS executive appeared to be a key factor in influencing the extent of integration.",Journal of Management Information Systems,14,1997,1,185,214

Transaction processing must continue as long as a single copy is available. But in a multiple failure environment, each operational site must make correct decisions about which copy to update and which one will be updated by the recovery system. This requires refreshing the copies on failed sites that missed the updates and doing this correctly while other transactions are updating and some more sites are either failing or recovering. This problem has been classified as the ""replicated copy control problem."" In this paper, we present several ideas that are necessary to attack and manage this problem. We introduce the ideas of session numbers, nominal session vectors, fail locks, and view serializability and discuss their role in transaction processing on operational, recovering, and partitioned sites. We have experimented with many of these ideas in a prototype system called RAID and we present the implementation issues. There is little overhead associated with our approach if no failures occur.",Journal of Management Information Systems,4,1987,2,93,112

Despite this increasing interest, information systems (IS) literature is mostly silent on what really contributes to the success of e-government Web sites. To fill this gap, this study examines the role of trust in e-government success using the updated DeLone and McLean IS success model as the theoretical framework. The model is tested via a survey of 214 Singapore e-government Web site users. The results show that trust in government, but not trust in technology, is positively related to trust in e-government Web sites. Further, trust in e-government Web sites is positively related to information quality, system quality, and service quality. The quality constructs have different effects on ""intention to continue"" using the Web site and ""satisfaction"" with the Web site. Post hoc analysis indicates that the nature of usage (active versus passive users) may help us better understand the interrelationships among success variables examined in this study. This result suggests that the DeLone and McLean model can be further extended by examining the nature of IS use. In addition, it is important to consider the role of trust as well as various Web site quality attributes in understanding e-government success.",Journal of Management Information Systems,25,2008,3,99,131

Specifically, we hypothesize that OC mediates the influence of (1) job satisfaction, (2) perceived job characteristics, (3) perceived competitiveness of pay, and (4) perceived job alternatives on turnover intention. Also, perceived job alternatives are modeled as having a direct effect on turnover intention. Analysis provides moderate empirical support for the research model. OC and perceived job alternatives demonstrated distinct effects on turnover intention. In addition, OC mediated the influence of job satisfaction, perceived job characteristics, and perceived competitiveness of pay on turnover intention. Findings suggest that through cultivating positive beliefs about the job and attitudes toward the employer, managers may counter the influence of external markets on IT workers' turnover intention.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,3,231,261

Clemons,Managing the Costs of Informational Privacy: Pure Bundling as a Strategy in the Individual Health Insurance Market, bundling;  information privacy;  insurance markets;  insurance policy;  privacy;  privacy cost,"Advances in genetic testing and data mining technologies have increased the availability of genetic information to insurance companies and insureds (applicants and policy holders) in the individual health insurance market (IHIM). Regulators, concerned that insurance companies will use this information to discriminate against applicants who have a genetic risk factor but who are still healthy, have implemented genetic privacy legislation in at least 18 states. However, in previous work we have demonstrated that such legislation will have unintended consequences--it will reduce consumer participation in the market without making those remaining better off. This paper identifies a mechanism, a pure bundling strategy, that insurance companies may implement in this regulatory environment to restore (or maximize) consumer participation in the market and to discourage such discrimination among insureds. This problem is examined through System Dynamics, a simulation-based modeling technique. The results will have significant implications for policy designs implemented by insurance companies, and for legislation implemented by industry regulators, and therefore, for the insurability of the individuals that rely on this market for health insurance coverage.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,2,29,57

However, the results of these studies, especially those examining the contribution of IT to productivity, have been mixed. One reason for these mixed empirical findings may be that these studies have not effectively accounted for the impact of technology investments that increase production efficiency and improve product quality on firm productivity. In particular, it is commonly assumed that such investments should lead to gains in both profits and productivity. However, using a closed-form analytical model we challenge this underlying assumption and demonstrate that investments in certain efficiency-enhancing technologies may be expected to decrease the productivity of profit-maximizing firms. More specifically, we demonstrate that investments in technologies that reduce the firm's fixed overhead costs do not affect the firm's product quality and pricing decisions but do increase profits and improve productivity. In addition, we demonstrate that investments in technologies that reduce the variable costs of designing, developing, and manufacturing a product encourage the firm to improve product quality and to charge a higher price. Although this adjustment helps the firm to capture higher profits, we show that it will also increase total production costs and will, under a range of conditions, decrease firm productivity. Finally, we show that the direction of firm productivity following such investments depends upon the relationship between the fixed costs of the firm and the size of the market.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,2,17,45

We solve the duopoly and monopoly models for four cost functions, where each function makes a different assumption about the form of the marginal cost of production. These models are used to conduct a two-by-four comparison [(monopoly, duopoly) x (four cost functions)] of the impact of IT investments on economic performance. The analysis reveals that together market structure and cost structure play a critical role in determining the form of the relationship between IT investment and economic measures. Specifically, moving from monopoly to duopoly and moving from zero marginal cost to marginal cost as a function of quality increase the number of economic measures for which the directional effects of IT investment are ambiguous, or depend on model parameter values.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,2,61,85

We find that the optimal patent policy is to grant patent protection for the entire life of the innovative software product (i.e., set infinite patent length) and to set the novelty and nonobviousness requirement for attaining a patent (i.e., patent height) and the scope of patent protection (i.e., patent width) such that both the innovator and imitator produce higher-quality products than they would in the free market. This policy not only maximizes social welfare but also makes the innovator, imitator, and consumers better off than in the free market. However, counter to intuition, we find that firms exhibit lower research and development intensity under the socially optimal patent policy than they do under free market competition. While highly stylized, the model offers a useful framework within which researchers and regulators can think about the economic trade-offs among three patent policy parameters (length, height, and width) simultaneously.",Journal of Management Information Systems,26,2009,3,103,133

Respondents were classified on the basis of their self-reported skill level and length of time having used personal computers. Three competing ways of modeling the influence of experience were tested: (1) a direct influence, (2) an indirect influence through six distinct attitude and belief components, and (3) a moderating influence on the relations between the attitude/belief components and utilization. The results suggested that experience influenced utilization directly, that indirect influences were present but less pronounced, and that the moderating influence of experience on the relations between five of six antecedent constructs and utilization was generally quite strong. For researchers, the implications are that prior experience with an information technology (IT) is an important factor to include when developing, testing, or applying models of IT adoption and use. For practitioners, the results highlight the importance of emphasizing applicability of the information technology to the current job and professional development early in the adoption process, with more emphasis on future benefits as experience is gained.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,1,167,187

The model specifies contextual variables such as decision-maker characteristics, IS characteristics, organizational characteristics, and environmental characteristics as primary determinants of IS adoption in small businesses. A questionnaire survey was conducted in 166 small businesses. Data analysis shows that small businesses with certain CEO characteristics (innovativeness and level of IS knowledge), innovation characteristics (relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity of IS), and organizational characteristics (business size and level of employees' IS knowledge) are more likely to adopt IS. While CEO and innovation characteristics are important determinants of the decision to adopt, they do not affect the extent of IS adoption. The extent of IS adoption is mainly determined by organizational characteristics. Finally, the environmental characteristic of competition has no direct effect on small business adoption of IS.",Journal of Management Information Systems,15,1999,4,187,214

This strategy leads to market segmentation and has been shown to be optimal by many researchers. On the other hand, researchers have also demonstrated, under certain restrictive conditions, that vertical differentiation may not be optimal for information goods. We analyze vertical differentiation for a monopolist, continuing the practice of modeling consumer valuation as a linear function of product quality and consumer type but generalizing assumptions about marginal costs and consumer distributions. We show that the firm's optimal product line depends on the benefit-to-cost ratio of qualities in the choice vector. We find that a vertical differentiation strategy is not optimal when the highest quality product has the best benefit-to-cost ratio.

This paper compares the information systems (IS) effectiveness of a group of small businesses that engage separate consultants and vendors (consultant-vendor approach) with that of another group of small businesses that engage vendors who also provide consultancy service (vendor-only approach). The results show that small businesses that adopt the vendor-only approach have more effective information systems than small businesses that adopt the consultant-vendor approach. Further, the vendor-only approach results in the same level of consultant effectiveness and a better level of vendor support for small businesses compared with the consultant-vendor approach. The relationship between vendor and other parties in the IS implementation project is found to be an important predictor of IS effectiveness.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,2,209,231

The case analysis shows that while there are similarities in the BPR experiences of public and private organizations, there are also notable differences. In this specific case, there were social and political pressures to reengineer, press publicity to promote BPR, a reengineering team comprised mainly of neutral staff, performance benchmarks adapted from the private sector, high-level approval for redesigned processes, and a pilot site implementation to secure further funding.

It is proposed that the congruence between the work values held by an individual and the perception of support for those values by an information system will affect the decision to use the system. Using a modified version of Elizur's Work Value Questionnaire, the work values and perceptions of IS support for those values are examined. Three factors that relate to the subjects' orientation to the world--societal, organizational, and individual--are isolated. The organizational orientation is found to be the most influential of the three in determining voluntary user participation, explaining 47 percent of the variation among subjects' usage patterns of a bulletin board system. These findings support the contention that when users became convinced of the efficacy of using an IS in mediating organizationally bestowed values, and when they perceive value in these organizational relationships, the system is used.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,1,107,126

These notions often incorporate models that generally prescribe information technologies as enabling agents for directed organizational change. Such concepts reflect highly cohesive, self-referential systems of beliefs, goals, and rules that structure perspectives about computerization and work in organizations. To achieve ""breakthrough"" changes in efficiency, performance, or competitive advantage, organizations must translate these high concepts into a specific model of change appropriate for their organizational context. This study shows how abstract and institutional-level conceptions about change are translated into actionable and individual-level realities, and how within this translation the organization's ability to reform can be locked into a constraining process. As consultants bridge institutionalized conceptions of management to discrete organizational activities, participants of change adopt not only the vision of change but also new ways to talk, act, and plan. This adoption may inhibit change by blocking effective discussion and forcing compliance to ill-fitting prescriptions.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,2,115,152

Yi-Cheng,Personalized Content Recommendation and User Satisfaction: Theoretical Synthesis and Empirical Findings, content recommendation;  personalization;  recommendation systems;  user satisfaction,"Personalized services are increasingly popular in the Internet world. This study identifies theories related to the use of personalized content services and their effect on user satisfaction. Three major theories have been identified--information overload, uses and gratifications, and user involvement. The information overload theory implies that user satisfaction increases when the recommended content fits user interests (i.e., the recommendation accuracy increases). The uses and gratifications theory indicates that motivations for information access affect user satisfaction. The user involvement theory implies that users prefer content recommended by a process in which they have explicit involvement. In this research, a research model was proposed to integrate these theories and two experiments were conducted to examine the theoretical relationships. Our findings indicate that information overload and uses and gratifications are two major theories for explaining user satisfaction with personalized services. Personalized services can reduce information overload and, hence, increase user satisfaction, but their effects may be moderated by the motivation for information access. The effect is stronger for users whose motivation is in searching for a specific target. This implies that content recommendation would be more useful for knowledge management systems, where users are often looking for specific knowledge, rather than for general purpose Web sites, whose customers often come for scanning. Explicit user involvement in the personalization process may affect a user's perception of customization, but has no significant effect on overall satisfaction.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,3,45,70

With self-evolving capabilities, a DSS will be able to provide a flexible menu hierarchy and a dynamic user interface. The major difference between the self-evolving design and a DSS developed by current approaches such as system development life cycle and user-involved evolutionary design is that the former has an extra componentâ€”the evolutionary mechanismâ€”to control the evolution of the system. In order to develop self-evolving capabilities, the following three components must be developed: (1) a database of user profiles to keep track of related system usage data, (2) a knowledge base to store rules for determining appropriate system default policy, and (3) a control mechanism to control the evolution of the system.",Journal of Management Information Systems,4,1987,1,59,82

In other words, are they complements or substitutes? Competing theoretical perspectives favor both sides of the argument, and neither the information systems (IS) controls literature nor the information technology (IT) outsourcing literature has addressed this issue. This study theoretically develops the idea that these competing perspectives are mutually compatible rather than contradictory because informal and formal control mechanisms can simultaneously be complements and substitutes. Using data from 120 outsourced systems development projects, it is shown that informal control mechanisms strengthen the influence of formal behavior control mechanisms on systems development ambidexterity (complementary effects) but weaken the influence of formal outcome control mechanisms (substitutive effects). The key contribution of the paper therefore lies in exploring interactions among control mechanisms in a project's control portfolio to reconcile the competing theoretical perspectives on whether formal and informal controls are complements or substitutes. The findings provide managers guidance on how to carefully combine formal and informal control mechanisms in a project. Combining informal with formal process-based control mechanisms can simultaneously enhance the fulfillment of project goals and development flexibility. However, combining informal with formal outcome-based control mechanisms can instead impair these objectives.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,87,126

Further application and process novelty are increasingly unavoidable in systems development projects but remain largely overlooked in theory. It is plausible that one type of peripheral knowledge is valuable under one type of novelty but not the other.I develop the idea that discriminating alignment between project novelty and peripheral knowledge is needed for them to enhance systems development performance. Thus, the valuable type of peripheral knowledge depends on whether a project involves novelty in the project concept or in its development processes. Further, we lack an explanation for how such discriminating alignment translates into improved project performance. I develop and test a middle-range theory built around two ideas to address these gaps. First, alignment between project novelty and peripheral knowledge must be discriminating to enhance systems development performance. Second, such discriminating alignment accelerates design convergence, which in turn enhances systems development performance. Tests using data from 159 projects support the proposed ideas. The primary contribution of this paper is therefore explaining when and how alignment between project novelty and peripheral knowledge in IT and client departments enhances systems development performance. The key implication is that greater application domain knowledge in the IT unit (technical knowledge in the client department) enhances performance in projects involving greater application novelty (process novelty).",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,15,52

Under contingency pricing of an information good or service, the firm preannounces a rebate for poor performance. Consumers determine performance probabilities using publicly available historical performance data, and the firm may have additional private information with respect to its future probability distribution. Examining the monopoly case, we explicate the critical role of private information and differences in belief between the firm and market in the choice of pricing scheme. Contingent pricing is useful when the market underestimates the firm's performance; then it is optimal for the firm to offer a full-price rebate for misperformance, with a correspondingly higher price for meeting the performance standard. We study the competitive value of contingency pricing in a duopoly setting where the firms differ in their probabilities of meeting the performance standard, but are identical in other respects. Contingency pricing is a dominant strategy for a firm when the market underestimates the firm's performance. Whereas both firms would earn equal profits if they were constrained to standard pricing, the superior firm earns greater profits under contingency pricing by setting lower expected prices. We show that contingency pricing is efficient as well, and consumer surplus increases because more consumers buy from the superior firm.",Journal of Management Information Systems,20,2003,2,113,136

Although a variety of theories have been invoked to study the initial outsourcing decision, much of this work has relied in isolation on one theoretical perspective. Therefore, the relative importance ascribed by managers to the factors from these theories is poorly understood. The majority of this work also masks interesting insights into outsourcing decisions by focusing on the information technology (IT) function rather than individual projects as the unit of analysis, where many of these decisions occur. In contrast, prior research at the project level has focused on predicting development performance in the postoutsourcing-decision phases of projects. The objective of this study is to examine the relative importance that IT managers ascribe to various factors from three complementary theories--transaction cost economics, agency theory, and knowledge-based theory--as they simultaneously consider them in their project outsourcing decisions. A secondary objective is to assess the cross-cultural robustness (United States versus Japan in this study) of such models in predicting project-level IT outsourcing decisions. We develop and test a multitheoretic model using data on 1,008 project-level decisions collected from 33 Japanese and 55 U.S. managers. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the relative importance that managers ascribe to the factors from these three theories, their complementarities and occasional contradictions, and offer new insights into the differences among U.S. and Japanese IT managers.

This study attempts to address this gap using data on 57 outsourced and 79 internal projects in 136 organizations. Our results reveal a paradoxical overarching pattern: controllers attempt greater use of control mechanisms in outsourced projects relative to internal projects, yet controls enhance systems development performance in internal projects but not in outsourced projects. We introduce a distinction between attempted control and realized control to explain this disconnect, and show how anticipated transaction hazards motivate the former but meeting specific informational and social prerequisites facilitate the latter. Our results contribute three new insights to the systems development control literature. First, controllers attempt to use controller-driven control mechanisms to a greater degree in outsourced projects but controllee-driven control mechanisms to a greater degree in internal projects. Second, we establish a hitherto-missing control--performance link. The nuanced differences in internal and outsourced projects simultaneously confirm and refute a pervasive assertion in the information systems controls literature that control enhances performance. Finally, we show how requirements volatility--which can be at odds with control--alters the control--performance relationships.

We develop the idea that team creativity results primarily from integration of individually held expertise of team members at the team level. We further propose the quality of intrateam relationships and knowledge complementarities that align the work of individual team members at the project level influence creativity primarily through the process of expertise integration. We use data from a field study of 142 participants in 42 ISD projects to test the proposed model. The paper makes three new contributions to the IS literature. Its key contribution lies in developing an expertise integration view of team creativity. We demonstrate the centrality of integrating individually held tacit and explicit knowledge about the problem domain and the technology at the team level in achieving team creativity. The use of a process-focused conceptualization of team creativity is especially noteworthy here. The second contribution of the paper lies in conceptually developing and operationalizing the concept of expertise integration, a mechanism by which individually held knowledge is integratively applied at the project level. Although the importance of knowledge in the ISD process is widely recognized in prior research, this is the first study to develop the concept in a operationally meaningful way. The third key contribution lies in showing that the compositional and relational attributes of ISD project teams--diverse specialized knowledge in a team, the quality of intrateam working relationships, and members' cross-domain absorptive capacity--do not engender creativity by themselves; they do so primarily because they enhance integration of individual knowledge at the project level. We offer empirical evidence for such full mediation. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed in the paper.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,1,13,43

They offer that the formulation and execution of tactics may be organized around the general question of how to effectively integrate EDI with internal systems, since this appears to be crucial for obtaining the expected performance advantages. They distinguish between two integration concepts, including the integration between the EDI systems and internal systems (interface integration), and the integration among the internal systems (internal integration). Based on theory and literature, they propose that interface integration is favorably related to performance outcomes, and that interface integration and internal integration are positively related. Using data from the Group Insurance industry, they obtain supportive findings. They conclude that tactical EDI planning should centrally focus on interface integration regardless of how intensively management plans to use EDI. They further conclude that management may want to consider internal integration as a risk factor during EDI implementation, because the ability to establish high interface integration may be inhibited or advanced by low or high internal integration, respectively.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,1,209,244

Major firms in the computing industry such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems are focusing on agility and flexibility of computing resources and gearing up for their own versions of on-demand computing and information technology (IT) outsourcing solutions. The successful introduction of these new computing models requires the development of appropriate pricing mechanisms that are consistent with the enabling technologies. Our paper introduces the notion of contingent auctions to address this lacuna. In contingent auctions, users bid for computing resources in an auction, but are relieved from the contract (paying a penalty) if demand is not realized. We study different mechanisms--ranging from an advance commitment (capacity reservation) to no commitment (pay-as-you-go)--under demand uncertainty. We consider markets in which the demand for computing is uncertain and, moreover, users' value of computing and demand realization may be related. We show how the different levels of commitment affect prices, revenues, and resource utilization under different market conditions. Our results reiterate the need to address the availability-commitment dichotomy in the design of business models for on-demand computing and IT outsourcing.",Journal of Management Information Systems,21,2004,2,201,227

Marsden,Trading Volumes with and Without Private Information: A Study Using Computerized Market Experiments, insider trading;  asymmetric information;  security market;  market regulations;  laboratory experiments,"Insider trading and asymmetric information have been the subject of a significant body of research since the 1960s. Yet little work has been directed at analyzing the impact of different market regulations. Along with difficulties in correctly identifying trades made on inside information, empirical field study methods have not been capable of analyzing the impact of different market regulations. The authors develop a controllable networked market trading environment that incorporates accurate identification of information possessed by each trader studied and that provides the flexibility necessary to analyze market impacts of different regulatory schemes to limit trading on inside information. The authors illustrate their methods through a series of controlled induced-value laboratory experiments using human subjects. Subject rewards are performance-based, with cash incentives tied to the outcomes of each market transaction. Experimental results indicate that markets with inside, privately informed traders led to greater trading volumes than markets with traders having access to private information only. In addition to reporting the results of initial sets of the experiments, the authors use these outcomes to frame future research issues involving the use of IT systems in surveillance and links between trading patterns and insider activity.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2000,1,31,57
1289, Ilkka Tuomi,Data Is More Than Knowledge: Implications of the Reversed Knowledge Hierarchy for Knowledge Management and Organizational Memory, information;  knowledge;  knowledge management,"The knowledge management literature often points out the importance of distinguishing among data, information, and knowledge. The generally accepted view sees data as simple facts that become information as data are combined into meaningful structures, which subsequently become knowledge as meaningful information is put into a context and when it can be used to make predictions. According to this view, data are a prerequisite for information, and information is a prerequisite for knowledge. This paper explores the conceptual hierarchy of data, information, and knowledge, showing that data emerge only after we have information, and that information emerges only after we already have knowledge. The reversed hierarchy of knowledge is shown to lead to a different approach in developing information systems that support knowledge management and organizational memory. It is also argued that this difference may have major implications for organizational flexibility and renewal.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,3,103,117

This study examines how justice and trust affect user acceptance of e-customer services by conducting an online experiment involving 380 participants. The results suggest that trust in the e-customer service fully mediates the effects of trust in the service representative and procedural justice on intentions to reuse the e-customer service. Furthermore, the effect of distributive justice on trust in the e-customer service was fully mediated by trust in the e-service representative. Finally, the effect of informational justice on user intentions to reuse the e-customer service was partially mediated by trust in the service representative and trust in the e-customer service. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2008,4,123,151

Moral hazard was defined as an incentive to act in one's self-interest in conflict with the organization's overall goals while being able to hide those actions through privately held information. Highly experienced IS professionals provided responses to a hypothetical decision case that revealed a tendency to implement a project with quality problems in a moral hazard situation. Their decisions, however, were strongly influenced by ethical considerations. These findings suggest that key economic constructs, such as moral hazard, apply to system implementation contexts. They also suggest that organizations can significantly moderate self-interested behavior by fostering an ethical climate.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1997,4,7,27

Studies of non-computer-mediated group work have long been guided by mathematical models of group interaction and performance, but recent research suggests that these models do not fit the unique capabilities of computer-mediated systems. This article builds on Previous group research to create a mathematical model of computer-mediated group performance which is then tested using data from two prior studies. This testing enabled us to conclude that models of computer-mediated groups run counter to the many guiding models of non-computer-mediated groups. We therefore discuss the implications of these differences in relation to users of this technology and to future developmental and empirical research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,11,1994,1,59,72

Trying to align distinct and separate business with IT management cycles is just not enough. Multilevel, integrated business and IT management are aimed at fully integrating the capabilities of IT with business strategies and management's expectations, and vice versa. Although the need to integrate business and IT strategy has long been advocated, until now a practical framework did not exist. The authors seek to contribute to the discipline of IT value management. Their framework includes the planning of and setting goals for IT, and the evaluation of results, integrated with the business context. First approaches to IT planning and evaluation, and their limitations, are discussed. They then elaborate on the concepts of the Balanced Business Scorecard in two case studies. By investigating the benefits and limitations of the framework, and comparing them with other common frameworks, they conclude that the Balanced Business Scorecard can be a valuable contributor to implementation of an integrated business and IT planning and evaluation process.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,2,137,156

The meeting is used to log the defects found in preparation and to search for more defects. The effectiveness and efficiency of the meeting are typically low compared with those of preparation. This paper describes the use of an electronic meeting system (EMS) to support the logging meeting of a total of fourteen electronic inspections in Philips Medical Systems and Baan Company. The results indicate that the electronic logging meeting contributed much more to the overall result of the inspection than was the case in a traditional inspection.

Our study empirically tests a model of trust in IT artifacts that increases our understanding in two ways. First, it sets forth two previously unexamined system quality constructs--navigational structure and visual appeal. We found that both of these system quality constructs significantly predict the extent to which users place trust in mobile commerce technologies. Second, our study considers the effect of culture by comparing the trust of French and American potential users in m-commerce technologies. We found that not only does culture directly affect user trust in IT artifacts but it also moderates the extent to which navigational structure affects this form of trust. These findings show that system quality and culture significantly affect trust in the IT artifact and point to rich possibilities for future research in these areas.",Journal of Management Information Systems,24,2008,4,73,100

Given the operational demands of dynamic organizations, current approaches to curbing access policy violations are insufficient. This study presents a new approach for reducing access policy violations, introducing both the theory of accountability and the factorial survey to the information systems field. We identify four system mechanisms that heighten an individual's perception of accountability: identifiability, awareness of logging, awareness of audit, and electronic presence. These accountability mechanisms substantially reduce intentions to commit access policy violations. These results not only point to several avenues for future research on access policy violations but also suggest highly practical design-artifact solutions that can be easily implemented with minimal impact on organizational insiders.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2013,4,263,290

Groupware is widely touted as the information technology that can support this new mode of work by fostering collaboration. In a study of Lotus Notes, a popular groupware product, implemented throughout the professional staff of a large American insurance company, we found the impact of groupware to be somewhat different from certain common expectations. While almost everyone was quite pleased with the Notes, implementation and its perceived impact, there was no evidence of a change in the degree of collaboration among organization members. Two key themes are explored as possible explanations for this result: fit of the technology to the organization, and limited training in how best to use this new technology.",Journal of Management Information Systems,13,1996,3,65,81

While recently the idea of competitive differentiation through IT has been challenged, this study contrasts the traditional thinking about competitive advantage with the re source-based view. Specifically, it is argued that by demarcating specific types of capabilities, we can contribute to better understanding of the sources of IT-based competitive advantage. Conceptually, we distinguish here between value, competitive, and dynamic capabilities as three distinct types of capabilities. Within each type, we identify specific capabilities. such as quality of the IT infrastructure. IT business experience, relationship infrastructure, and intensity of organizational learning, and present a model that describes relationships between these capabilities and competitive advantage. We then empirically test the model using data collected via a national mail survey from chief IT executives from 202 manufacturing firms. While the quality of the IT infrastructure is hypothesized as a value capability and expectedly did not have any significant effect on competitive advantage, the quality of IT business expertise and the relationship infrastructure (competitive capabilities) did. The results of the study also indicate that the intensity of organizational learning (dynamic capability) was significantly related to all of the capabilities. These results point to the importance of delineating capabilities such as relationship infrastructure that can facilitate differentiation in the marketplace, and dynamic capabilities such as organizational learning as an important antecedent to IT capability building.",Journal of Management Information Systems,22,2005,2,253,277

This model describes the impact of ESS on perceptions of competitive performance when viewed from a learning perspective. The model proposes two types of learning: mental-model maintenance, in which new information fits into existing mental models and confirms them; and mental-model building, in which mental models are changed to accommodate new information. The results of a survey of seventy-three executives support the view that the success of ESS may be contingent upon the type of executive learning they engender. The research found that perceptions of competitive performance resulting from ESS use are strongly related to mental-model building, but found no link between competitive performance and mental-model maintenance. Hence, it seems that ESS can and do foster executive learning. Nevertheless, organizations that embark on ESS development on the basis of promised gains in competitive performance should proceed cautiously. The presence of analysis capability seems to be the best differentiation between mental-model maintenance and mental-model building, leading to a consideration of behaviour vis-Ã -vis the ESS as a predictor of learning. Without mental-model building, competitive performance gains seem unlikely. In addition, companies should be leery of systems that are justified on the basis of improved technical quality.",Journal of Management Information Systems,12,1995,2,99,130

This study makes two main contributions. First, we show that in the presence of low uncertainty, centralization of data management decisions creates more total surplus for the firm as the similarity of business units increases. In contrast, in the presence of high uncertainty, centralization creates more total surplus as the dissimilarity of business units increases. The pivoting distinction trades the benefit of reduction of uncertainty from dissimilar businesses for centralization (with cost saving) against the benefit of flexibility from decentralization. Second, the framework helps senior management evaluate the trade-offs in data centralization that drive different business models of the firm. We illustrate the application of these propositions formally using an analytical model and informally using case vignettes and simulation.",Journal of Management Information Systems,30,2013,3,179,212

By illustrating similarities between the research streams of MIS planning and organizational strategic planning, we derive three major guidelines from a critical review and evaluation of the progress made in the strategic research stream over the last decade. These are: (i) recognition of hierarchy of MIS planning levels and corresponding hierarchy in MIS planning benefits; (ii) specific attention to operationalization of constructs to ensure correspondence between theoretical conceptualization and empirical observation; and (iii) the adoption of an overarching research framework rooted in the contingency theory tradition.

Within this framework, point-to-point data communication over a network composed of various media remains the most frequent communication mode. With a large base of network infrastructure in place, the need for incremental capacity increase due to new users who join existing networks has become a recurring problem. Accommodation of new users without downgrading the quality of service that has been provided to existing users requires network capacity expansion. A method is presented for computing the least-cost expansion of link capacities (defined as the number of lines in a link) on a point-to-point path in a network, subject to the constraint on the grade of service.

Attention is usually focused almost exclusively on the method of transformation, however, with little recognition of the role of the application. As a first step in examining the relevance of knowledge of the application to the systems development process, this study addresses whether there are synergistic effects of application and methodology knowledge in specifying information requirements. This was achieved via a repeated-measures protocol analysis study that manipulated both experience with the application and knowledge of the methodology. The results show that in learning to specify information requirements, novice analysts: performed more effectively over time when trained to use a methodology applied the methodology more effectively when familiar with the application; performed more effectively when they used procedural methodology knowledge rather than declarative methodology knowledge alone; improved the effectiveness of their problem solving over time only when they used procedural methodology knowledge; produced idiosyncratic results based on the application. Based on the findings of this research, it appears that research into the nature of applications, as well as methodologies, is warranted. From the viewpoint of the practitioner, since application knowledge is idiosyncratic, it may be necessary to include more than one application-knowledgable person on a systems development team.",Journal of Management Information Systems,10,1993,2,177,201

Our overall objective in this study is to better understand the diversity in IS research, and the extent to which diversity is universal across journals that publish IS research. We developed a classification system that comprises five key characteristics of diversity (reference discipline, level of analysis, topic, research approach, and research method) based on a review of prior literature. We then examined articles over a five-year period, from 1995 to 1999, in five journals acknowledged as the top journals of the field, at least in North America. Analyses reveal considerable diversity in each of the key characteristics. Perhaps not surprisingly, the research approach used is more focused with most studies being conducted using hypothetico-deductive approaches, whereas reference discipline is perhaps the most diverse of the characteristics examined. An interesting finding is that IS itself emerged as a key reference discipline in the late 1990s. The 'Journal of Management Information Systems' and 'Information Systems Research' publish articles displaying the greatest diversity, and 'MIS Quarterly' and 'Decision Sciences' publish articles that focus on subsets of the field. Our research provides a foundation for addressing the direction that diversity in the IS discipline takes over time. In the shorter term, researchers can use our classification system as a guide to writing abstracts and selecting key words, and the findings of our journal analyses to determine the best outlet for their type of research.",Journal of Management Information Systems,19,2002,2,129,174

Often labeled as ""internal open source"" (IOS), several large firms have started to implement these programs. Research to date has mostly focused on facilitating IOS adoption. In the present research, we focus on how IOS affects reuse. Employing a qualitative case study, we examine the IOS program at IBM called ""Community Source."" Analyzing data gathered from multiple sources reveals that IOS adoption facilitates participatory reuse by enhancing information sharing and leveraging of broader community skills. Participatory reuse manifests itself when potential reusers participate in the entire development process leading to the creation of reusable assets. Based on data, we develop a theoretical model to illustrate how IOS affects reuse. While furthering research on IOS and reuse, the model informs managers wishing to foster participatory reuse that they are wise to adopt IOS as a vehicle to promote greater openness of the software development infrastructure for leveraging broader community skills and enhancing information sharing among projects' stakeholders.",Journal of Management Information Systems,27,2010,2,277,304

Here, we investigate one type of digital experience good--music--whose market environment includes the very real presence of online piracy. Although arguments abound for and against online distribution of such digital goods, little research exists in this area. We develop a model of consumer search for such an experience good, and study different emerging market environments for retailers, where consumers can pirate music online. Retailer cost to publishers is modeled using a variety of licensing schemas. Survey results, together with data from online sharing networks, are utilized to validate a key assumption. Finally, computational analysis is used to develop insights that cannot be obtained analytically. Our results indicate that decreasing piracy is not necessarily equivalent to increasing profit, and online selling strategies can provide additional profits for a traditional retailer even in the presence of piracy. We show that leading strategies for business in such goods should include pricing options, provision of efficient search tools, and new licensing structures.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,1,129,159

The study is composed of two parts. First, a job-content analysis of 800 Webmaster positions is conducted in order to determine the mix of skills demanded of Webmasters by employers. Second, a survey of 232 Webmasters is conducted to test the relationships between those skills and job performance. The job-content analysis suggested that employers seek technical skills over organizational skills, and, in contrast, the survey results showed that Webmasters regard organizational skills as more important in performing their jobs. Structured equation modeling on the survey data showed that deficiency in both technical and organizational skills leads to lower job performance. Moreover, the effect of organizational skill deficiencies on job performance was found to be larger than that of technical skill deficiencies. For researchers, the establishment of an empirical link between job skills and job performance opens the field to further research in the skills of information systems personnel. For employers, the results suggest more attention should be paid to attracting organizational skills when recruiting information systems personnel, such as Webmasters.",Journal of Management Information Systems,18,2001,3,71,96

While customer-centricity has received recent attention in the marketing literature, technologies to enable customer-centricity have been largely ignored in research and theory development. In this paper, we describe one enabling technology--wikis. Wiki is a Web-based collaboration technology designed to allow anyone to update any information posted to a wiki-based Web site. As such, wikis can be used to enable customers to not only access but also change the organization's Web presence, creating previously unheard of opportunities for joint content development and ""peer production"" of Web content. At the same time, such openness may make the organization vulnerable to Web site defacing, destruction of intellectual property, and general chaos. In this zone of tension--between opportunity and possible failure--an increasing number of organizations are experimenting with the use of wikis and the wiki way to engage customers. Three cases of organizations using wikis to foster customer-centricity are described, with each case representing an ever-increasing level of customer engagement. An examination of the three cases reveals six characteristics that affect customer engagement--community custodianship, goal alignment among contributors, value-adding processes, emerging layers of participation, critical mass of management and monitoring activity, and technologies in which features are matched to assumptions about how the community collaborates.

We identified four key governance mechanisms for EA standards management and examined how each mechanism affected the use of EA standards. We also examined how the use of EA standards affects the management of IT infrastructure, applications, and data resources across business units. Our empirical results showed that the use of EA standards is effective in helping organizations to better manage their IT resources.

Neural network models are used to evaluate the claim that emerging equity markets, specifically the Singapore exchange, are affected by external signals and attempt to exploit any trading advantage imparted by these signals. The neural network technique as it is applied to trading on market indices in the ""emerging"" Singapore market is compared with the more established Dow Jones market index. Results indicate that external market signals can significantly improve forecasting on the Singapore DBSS0 index but have little or no effect on forecasts for the more established Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The research demonstrates the efficacy of using neural network methods to capitalize on discovered market inefficiencies. Utilizing external market signals, a neural network forecasting model achieved a 63 percent trading prediction accuracy.",Journal of Management Information Systems,16,1999,2,177,192
1317, Steven Walczak,An Empirical Analysis of Data Requirements for Financial Forecasting with Neural Networks, forecasting;  foreign exchange;  neural networks;  prediction accuracy;  time series;  training set size,"Neural networks have been shown to be a promising tool for forecasting financial time series. Several design factors significantly impact the accuracy of neural network forecasts. These factors include selection of input variables, architecture of the network, and quantity of training data. The questions of input variable selection and system architecture design have been widely researched, but the corresponding question of how much information to use in producing high-quality neural network models has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, the effects of different sizes of training sample sets on forecasting currency exchange rates are examined. It is shown that those neural networks--given an appropriate amount of historical knowledge--can forecast future currency exchange rates with 60 percent accuracy, while those neural networks trained on a larger training set have a worse forecasting performance. In addition to higher-quality forecasts, the reduced training set sizes reduce development cost and time.",Journal of Management Information Systems,17,2001,4,203,222

A new categorization of self-regulated learning strategies, that is, personal versus social learning strategies, is proposed, and measurement scales are developed. The new measures were tested using data collected from employees in a large company. Our approach provides context-relevant insights into online training providers and employees themselves. The results suggest that learners adopt different self-regulated learning strategies resulting in different e-learning outcomes. Furthermore, the use of self-regulated learning strategies is influenced by individual factors such as virtual competence and goal orientation, and job and contextual factors such as intellectual demand and cooperative norms. The findings can (1) help e-learners obtain better learning outcomes through their active use of varied learning strategies, (2) provide useful information for organizations that are currently using or plan to use e-learning for training, and (3) inform software designers to integrate self-regulated learning strategy support in e-learning system design and development.",Journal of Management Information Systems,29,2012,1,307,340

Jiang,ERP Misfit: Country of Origin and Organizational Factors, consultant quality;  country of origin;  Enterprise resource planning;  implementation;  misfit;  social shaping,"There are many benefits of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, but their implementation is both complicated and difficult because the product spans functional silos and involves many internal and external entities. An ERP system is the outcome of social processes, and different ERP systems can embody distinct social arrangements when developed in different cultural contexts. Such social arrangements are difficult to change due the closure effect of technology stabilization. This leads to various misfit problems, both during and after ERP implementation, causing adverse effects on delivered ERP quality. With a survey of 85 ERP implementation cases in Taiwan, this study derives and empirically tests the main as well as the interaction effects of the country of origin of the ERP package, consultant quality, top management support, and user support of the ERP system quality as perceived by the client after implementation. The results demonstrate the important role of the country of origin of the ERP package and consultant quality in configuring a high-quality ERP system and alleviating the negative effect of misfit problems.",Journal of Management Information Systems,23,2006,1,263,292
