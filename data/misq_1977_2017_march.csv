0,Curt Hartog; Martin Herbert,1985 Opinion Survey of MIS Managers:  Key Issues,MIS managers; opinion survey; aligning MIS; end-user computing,"This article identifies the issues which MIS management rates as most important and most difficult to solve over the next two years.  The results were obtained from a 1985 opinion survey of MIS managers in over 100 St. Louis area companies.  The most important issues fall into three categories:  aligning MIS with corporate goals, software development, and end-user computing; the least important issues were narrowly focused or more technical.  Comparison with prior research reveals that the alignment and end-user computing issues have increased in importance.  The results indicate that MIS managers are more oriented to corporate than to technical issues.",MIS Quarterly,10,1986,4,351,351
1,William M. Taggart; Valdur Silbey,A Balanced Orientation for the Information Systems Manager,information systems department; user orientation; systems professional orientation; stage of systems evolution; systems manager activity,"The orientation of an information systems department is influenced by the emphasis shown in the manager’s activities. Each incident in the manager’s daily work is another bead strung on a necklace. The choice of what type of bead it should be is up to the manager. Every incident permits a choice of emphasis: either a systems professional or a user community orientation.Recent analyses suggest that a new breed of information systems manager must emerge for advanced systems in organizations. Some of these analyses emphasize the user view without pointing to the continuing need for systems competence.Lest the pendulum swing too far in the opposite direction by ignoring technical aspects, this analysis suggests that the emerging information systems manager must bring a “balanced” systems and user orientation to the position. In so doing, the manager establishes the organizational climate in which the information systems activity proceeds.",MIS Quarterly,3,1979,2,21,21
2,Mary Lippitt Nichols,A Behavioral Analysis for Planning MIS Implementation,implementation; potential adopters; behavioral data; task activities; interactions; role preferences,"Planning for a successful MIS implementation requires understanding the effects of the introduction of a new system on the work lives of potential adopters. The effects can bee assessed by the MIS practitioner/change agent if the agent will first obtain a thorough and specific understanding of the task activities performed by potential adopters, the interactions they engage in as they perform their tasks, and their preferences for, or feelings about, those activities and interactions. An interview based approach to gathering this data is described, and a short description of an implementation in which the approach was used is provided.",MIS Quarterly,5,1981,1,57,57
3,John R. Weitzel; Kenneth R. Andrews,A Company/University Joint Venture to Build a Knowledge-Based System,System development; insurance claims processing; knowledge-based systems,"A joint venture between a university-based research institute and a health insurance company to build a knowledge-based system to perform medical review of health insurance claims is described.  In an early format test, the system made appropriate decisions for approximately 70% of the claims.  The remaining claims were referred to human reviewers in accordance with company policy.  Forming a joint venture proved to be a reasonable cost alternative to distant and more expensive consultants.The article examines the impact of the differing cultures of the company and the university on the cohesion in the joint knowledge engineering group.  It also examines the current literature on the development cycle for building knowledge-based systems as the framework for analyzing the events in this project, particularly the influence of the claims review task on system design.  From another perspective, it examines participant roles in terms of shifts of attention among domain knowledge, knowledge representation, system performance, and the kinds of skills needed to improve the evolving system.  The conclusion includes a series of recommendations that may assist other companies and universities setting up similar joint ventures.",MIS Quarterly,12,1988,1,23,23
4,Mel A. Colter,A Comparative Examination of Systems Analysis Techniques,analysis techniques; structured analysis; traditional analysis,"Though many analysis tools and techniques are available to systems professionals, none of them completely support the analysis process. Traditional techniques tend to clarify input and output detail, along with physical information flows. More current techniques tend to concentrate on considerations of system structure. This paper presents a set of dimensions which support the comparative examination of analysis methods. A number of methods are compared to clarify their similarities and differences. The comparison technique supports professionals in the combination of tools to ensure complete analysis products.",MIS Quarterly,8,1984,1,51,51

West,"A Comparison of Judgement, Skills, and Prompting Effects Between Auditors and Systems Analysts",Internal controls; internal control evaluation; EDP audit,"Arguments have been made supporting internal auditor involvement in the systems development process – arguments based primarily on the differential skills that auditor are thought to possess in the evaluation of internal controls.  This study investigates whether internal auditors possess such skills.  A second objective is to investigate the impact of recall versus recognition in the identification of control weaknesses and control measures.Two major findings are reported.  First, no consistent between group differences in different aspects of internal control evaluation were found.  Second, a significant prompting effect was shown across all three respondent groups.",MIS Quarterly,11,1987,2,151,151
6,Jon (Sean) Jasperson; Pamela E. Carter; Robert W. Zmud,A Comprehensive Conceptualization of Post-Adoptive Behaviors Associated with Information Technology Enabled Work Systems,IT adoption; IT use; post-adoptive behavior; IT value,"For the last 25 years, organizations have invested heavily in information technology to support their work processes.  In today’s organizations, intra- and interorganizational work systems are increasingly IT-enabled.  Available evidence, however, suggests the functional potential of these installed IT applications is underutilized.  Most IT users apply a narrow band of features, operate at low levels of feature use, and rarely initiate extensions of the available features.  We argue that organizations need aggressive tactics to encourage users to expand their use of installed IT-enabled work systems.  This article strives to accomplish three primary research objectives.  First, we offer a comprehensive research model aimed both at coalescing existing research on post-adoptive IT use behaviors and at directing future research on those factors that influence users to (continuously) exploit and extend the functionality built into IT applications.  Second, in developing this comprehensive research model, we provide a window (for researchers across a variety of scientific disciplines interested in technology management) into the rich body of research regarding IT adoption, use, and diffusion.  Finally, we discuss implications and recommend guidelines for research and practice.",MIS Quarterly,29,2005,3,525,525
7,Ulrike Schultze,A Confessional Account of an Ethnography About Knowledge Work,Social science; ethnography; evaluation criteria; practice; confessional genre of representation; objectivity; subjectivity; reflexivity; information; knowledge creation,"Information systems research has traditionally focused on information as an object that serves as input to decision making. Such a perspective attends mainly to the use of information. Increasingly, however, organizations are concerned about the production of information. This paper focuses on the work of producing informational objects, an activity central to knowledge work. Based on data collected during an eight-month ethnographic study of three groups of knowledge workers-computer system administrators, competitive intelligence analysts, and librarians - I explore the informing practices they relied upon. These are identified as ex-pressing, monitoring, and translating. Common to these informing practices is the knowledge workers’ endeavor to balance subjectivity and objectivity, where subjectivity is a necessary part of doing value adding work and objectivity promises workers authority and a sense of security. Recognizing that researchers are knowledge workers too, I draw on my own experiences as an ethnographic researcher to identify parallels between my informing practices and those of the knowledge workers I studied. These parallels are intended to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions underlying scientific practice. I adopt a confessional genre of representation for this purpose.",MIS Quarterly,24,2000,1,3,3

Johnson,A Configural Approach to Coordinating Expertise in Software Development Teams,Software development; software teams; expertise coordination; configuration; centralization; knowledge tacitness; team conflict; coordination success,"Despite the recognition of how important expertise coordination is to the performance of software development teams, understanding of how expertise is coordinated in practice is limited.  We adopt a configural approach to develop a theoretical model of expertise coordination that differentiates between design collaboration and technical collaboration.  We propose that neither a strictly centralized, top-down model nor a largely decentralized approach is superior.  Our model is tested in a field study of 71 software development teams.  We conclude that because design work addresses ill-structured problems with diverse potential solutions, decentralization of design collaboration can lead to greater coordination success and reduced team conflict.  Conversely, technical work benefits from centralized collaboration.  We find that task knowledge tacitness strengthens these relationships between collaboration configuration and coordination outcomes and that team conflict mediates the relationships.  Our findings underline the need to differentiate between technical and design collaboration and point to the importance of certain configurations in reducing team conflict and increasing coordination success in software development teams.  This paper opens up new research avenues to explore the collaborative mechanisms underlying knowledge team performance.9/2/16",MIS Quarterly,41,2017,01,43,43
9,William Doll; Xia; Torkzadeah,A Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the End-User Computing Satisfaction Instrument,end-user computing; IS success; IS research methodologies; user attitudes; multiple criteria evaluation,"The dimensionality of the user satisfaction construct is an important theoretical issue that has received considerable attention. Focusing on end users who directly interact with application software, Doll and Torkzadeah (1988) develop a 12-item application specific instrument for providing an overall assessment of end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS). They also contend that EUCS is comprised of five component measures (content, accuracy, format, ease of use, timeliness) that explain the construct and permit more precision in formulating and testing research hypotheses. The acceptance of the EUCS as a standardized instrument requires confirmation that it explains and measures the user satisfaction construct.Based on a sample of 409 respondents from 18 organizations, this research uses confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL) to test alternative models of underlying factor structure and assess the reliability and validity of factors and items. Without respecifying the model, the results provide some support for Doll and Torkzadeh's proposed model of the five first-order factors and one second-order (higher-order) factor. Thus the evidence supports the use of: (1) the 12-item instrument as an overall measure of EUCS; and (2) the five component factors for explaining the EUCS construct.",MIS Quarterly,18,1994,4,,
